# Remote live: the contract between agentd, rime-remoted, the CLI, the Shell and the phone

Working document for the `feat/remote-live` change set (2026-09-30). Every side
builds against THIS file; `android/core/src/test/resources/requests.json` and
`rimed/rime-agent-core/tests/android_requests_wire.rs` are where the phone's
bytes and the daemon's parser meet, so the JSON below is exact, not
illustrative.

Andre's asks: the phone is too slow to connect and to show a terminal ("always
connected"); see an agent's output without opening its terminal; name agents,
synced between phone and desktop, settable at start on the desktop; a reply
sent from the phone types but does not submit; opening a terminal on the phone
leaves the desktop terminal shrunk to the phone's size.

## 1. agentd protocol additions (no PROTOCOL_VERSION bump; old daemons answer `bad_request`)

### 1.1 `hello` advertises features

`Response::Hello` gains `#[serde(default)] features: Vec<String>`:

```json
{"reply":"hello","version":11,"agents":["claude"],"default_agent":"claude",
 "features":["input_submit","rename","peek","session_name","session_title","size_restore"]}
```

A client uses a feature only when its string is present. An absent `features`
key means none (an old daemon).

### 1.2 `input` can submit

```json
{"cmd":"input","id":3,"data":"yes please","submit":true}
```

`#[serde(default)] submit: bool`. With `submit:true` the daemon writes `data`,
waits **80 ms** (a constant, `SUBMIT_GAP`), then writes `"\r"` as a SEPARATE
write. Reason, measured 2026-09-30 against Claude Code 2.1.283 in a pty: a
~250-character burst ending in CR is taken as a paste and the CR becomes a
newline in the prompt (not submitted); the same text with the CR written 50 ms
or 250 ms later submits. Short bursts happen to submit, which is why it looked
intermittent. `data` should not end in CR/LF when `submit` is set (the phone's
`Reply.bytes` trims them); the daemon does not strip anything. Reply: `{"reply":"ok"}`.
`rime agent input --submit` uses this flag.

Old-daemon fallback (phone, when `input_submit` is absent): send
`input(data)`, sleep **100 ms** on the client, then `input("\r")`.

### 1.3 Session names

`SessionInfo` gains two fields, both `#[serde(default)]`, both ALWAYS
serialized (no `skip_serializing_if`), so `"name": null` means "this daemon
supports names, none is set" and a missing key means "old daemon":

- `name: Option<String>` — set only by a person: `rime agent run --name`,
  `rename` from the CLI, the Shell or the phone. Never from agent output.
- `title: Option<String>` — the agent's own terminal title (OSC 0 / OSC 2),
  captured by the output scanner: leading spinner/status glyphs (braille
  U+2800–U+28FF, `✳ ✻ ✶ ✢ · * ●` and similar) and surrounding whitespace
  stripped, control characters removed, at most 80 characters, `None` when
  empty. Display-only, agent-controlled, never trusted for anything.

Display order everywhere (Shell, CLI list, phone): `name` → `title` → today's
label (`<agent> · <project_name or cwd basename>`).

Validation (one function in rime-agent-core, used by daemon and CLI): trim;
empty → `None` (clears); at most **64** characters (chars, not bytes); no
control characters (`char::is_control`); refused, not sanitised, with a
sentence saying why.

### 1.4 `run` takes a name

`RunRequest` gains `#[serde(default)] name: Option<String>`. CLI:
`rime agent run --name <NAME>` / `-n <NAME>`, defaulting to the environment
variable `RIME_AGENT_NAME` when the flag is absent. Forwarded by
`forward_argv` (`--host`). NOT added to `settings_a_daemon_could_drop`
(dropping a label widens nothing). `aw <worktree>` defaults the name to the
worktree name when neither is given.

### 1.5 `rename`

```json
{"cmd":"rename","id":3,"name":"auth refactor"}
{"cmd":"rename","id":3,"name":null}
```

Reply: the updated session, `{"reply":"session", ...SessionInfo fields...}`.
Callers: allowed for exactly the callers `privilege::refuse_input` allows (a
person's shell, the Shell, a paired phone); refused for a managed session and
an unclassifiable caller — only a person names a session. Live sessions only
(`no_such_session` otherwise). The record is written (`registry::write_record`).
CLI: `rime agent rename <ID> <NAME>` and `rime agent rename <ID> --clear`.

### 1.6 `peek`: the tail of a session's output, without attaching

```json
{"cmd":"peek","id":3,"bytes":8192}
```

`#[serde(default)] bytes: Option<usize>`; the daemon caps it at **8192**
(`PEEK_MAX`), default 8192. Reads the in-memory scrollback ring (NOT the disk
transcript, which stops at 32 MiB). No resize, no attach, no change to
`attached`. Reply:

```json
{"reply":"peek","id":3,"data":"<base64 of raw PTY bytes>","cols":120,"rows":40,"state":"working"}
```

Base64 (standard alphabet, padded) because raw PTY bytes JSON-escape to up to
6× and a control frame is at most 65514 bytes: 8192 → ≤ 10924 base64 chars,
far inside it. The tail may start mid-escape-sequence or mid-UTF-8; the phone
feeds it to its terminal emulator at `cols`×`rows` and shows the bottom lines.
Allowed for the callers `refuse_input` allows (not for a managed session:
agents do not read each other's screens).

### 1.7 The phone's terminal no longer shrinks the desktop's

Today `handle_attach` resizes the PTY to whoever attached last, and nothing
puts it back. New rule (`size_restore` feature):

- agentd remembers the last size set by a LOCAL client (the `rime agent run` /
  `attach` terminal: its attach and its `resize` requests), per session.
- A remote-origin attach (origin class `RemoteControl`) still resizes to the
  phone while the phone is attached, but when the LAST remote attacher
  detaches, the PTY is resized back to the remembered local size (if the
  session has one).
- Stretch, only if attribution is clean: input arriving from a local client
  while a phone is attached resizes back to the local size ("latest typer
  wins", tmux's `window-size latest`).

Attribute by `privilege::origin` class, never by socket identity:
rime-remoted opens a fresh agentd connection per control frame, so a phone's
`resize` does not arrive on its attach socket.

## 2. rime-remoted additions

### 2.1 `remote_hello`, answered by rime-remoted itself (never forwarded)

```json
{"cmd":"remote_hello"}
→ {"reply":"remote","version":1,"features":["nodelay","control_worker","mux_attach","liveness"],"lan":["192.168.1.232:7717"]}
```

An old rime-remoted forwards it to agentd, which answers
`{"reply":"error","kind":"bad_request",...}`: the phone reads that as "no
features". `lan` is the current list of addresses this machine listens on
(same filter as pairing), so the phone can refresh its stored list.

### 2.2 Behaviour

- `TCP_NODELAY` on every accepted socket; one `write` per frame (header and
  body in one buffer).
- `control_worker`: control requests are handled on a per-connection worker
  thread, in order (FIFO replies preserved: the phone matches replies by order),
  so `Data`/`Open`/`Close`/`Ping`/`Pong` keep flowing while a slow control
  request runs. `Open` (attach/receive) setup also off the frame loop.
- `mux_attach`: with `control_worker`, a terminal opened on the SAME connection
  as control is safe; the phone may then stop dialling a connection per
  terminal.
- `liveness`: the session ping (15 s) now expects pongs; 3 missed → close the
  connection (the phone reconnects).
- Relay waiting socket: a read deadline (no frame for 75 s despite 30 s pings →
  re-dial); re-dial backoff capped at **10 s** (was 60); a `409` meaning "a host
  is already waiting" is not counted as a failure.

## 3. The phone

- Connect: race the last-good path first, then LAN addresses and the relay in
  parallel (relay after a 300 ms head start for LAN), first completed Noise
  handshake wins, losers closed. Remember the last-good path per machine
  (through `MachineStore`/`AppStorage` only: `android/tools/no-second-write-path.sh`).
  Refresh stored LAN addresses from `remote_hello.lan`. Retry a relay `409`
  (guest: no desktop waiting) at 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000 ms.
- One biometric prompt per launch (unlock the app and unwrap the identity in
  one auth), if the current code allows it without weakening the key rules.
- Always connected: a foreground service (`foregroundServiceType="specialUse"`,
  sideloaded so no Play declaration; update `ManifestTest`) holds the link
  while the app is unlocked; connect on unlock without waiting for a tap;
  reconnect on network change (`ConnectivityManager` callback) and on silence
  (no desktop ping for 40 s). Screen-off Doze may still drop the socket; the
  point is instant reconnect without re-auth.
- Terminals on the control connection when `remote_hello.features` has
  `mux_attach`; a new connection otherwise (today's behaviour). Replay
  default 64 KiB (was 256 KiB).
- Reply uses `input` + `submit:true` when `input_submit` is advertised, the
  100 ms two-request fallback otherwise.
- Live output: the session screen shows the bottom ~15 lines of a `peek`,
  refreshed every 1.5 s while visible; Agent Center rows show the last
  non-empty line for live sessions (peek only while the list is on screen).
- Names: display order as §1.3 everywhere in the app; rename from the session
  screen (`rename`). Names stay OUT of lock-screen notifications
  (`Notifications.kt` privacy rule is unchanged).
- Log one line per connect: `connected to <machine> via <lan|relay> in <N> ms`.

## 4. The Shell (rime-shell)

Display order as §1.3 in `SessionRow`, `RemoteSessionRow`, search and desktop
notifications; an inline rename in `SessionRow` through
`AgentService._act(["rime","agent","rename",id,name])` (the Agent Center
invariants forbid running anything directly).
