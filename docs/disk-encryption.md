# Disk encryption in the APEX-OS installer

This is the installer's half of L-002, "Enable LUKS2 by default". The other
half — what is enrolled into the LUKS2 header, and when a TPM keyslot is safe —
is `/usr/libexec/apex-luks-enroll` and `docs/boot-v2.md`.

The acceptance line for the item is *"encryption default does not strand users
across qualified hardware and recovery cases"*, so this document is organised
around the ways a person can be locked out, and what stops each one.

---

## What happens when encryption is on

`installer/apex-install` is handed `encrypt=yes` and a `lukspass=` in its
answers file, and builds the disk itself instead of letting `bootc install
to-disk` do it:

| part | size | type | filesystem | mounted at |
|------|------|------|-----------|------------|
| p1 | 1 GiB | `ef00` EFI System | FAT32 | `/boot/efi` |
| p2 | 1 GiB | `8300` Linux filesystem | ext4, **not encrypted** | `/boot` |
| p4 | 1 MiB | `ef02` BIOS boot | none | nothing |
| p3 | rest | `8309` Linux LUKS | LUKS2 → btrfs | `/` |

p4 is out of numerical order on purpose: sgdisk allocates in the order the
options are given, so the 1 MiB partition sits physically between `/boot` and
the encrypted volume while the numbers 1, 2 and 3 keep meaning what they have
always meant to the installer's own discovery, its tests, and the recovery
instructions below.

**Why a BIOS boot partition on a UEFI machine.** It is empty and unused on one.
It exists because a LOOPBACK install passes bootc `--generic-image` — the flag
that stops the building machine's UEFI boot entries being rewritten — and that
flag also makes bootupd install the i386-pc GRUB component. With nowhere to
embed `core.img`, `grub2-install` refuses ("will not proceed with blocklists")
and the install fails *after* the volume is already encrypted. Measured on
2026-09-20. One megabyte buys a layout that behaves the same in the lab and on
real hardware, which is worth more than the megabyte.

Then `bootc install to-filesystem` installs into the opened volume, with the
`/boot` partition already mounted so bootc picks up its UUID.

**Why `/boot` is outside the encryption.** APEX boots GRUB through bootupd.
GRUB can be talked into reading some LUKS2 headers, but not all, and the
failure mode of getting that wrong is a machine that does not boot at all
rather than one that asks for a passphrase. A separate plain `/boot` is what
Fedora ships for encrypted installs and what this repository's own runbook
specified (`docs/m4-install-runbook.md` §5b, `docs/m0-results.md` §9). The
kernel and initramfs living in the clear leak nothing: they are the same public
bytes as the published image, and their integrity is Secure Boot's job.

**Why the partition type is `8309` and not the discoverable root GUID.** The
initramfs carries `systemd-gpt-auto-generator`, which acts on the discoverable
*root* type. Typing the LUKS partition as generic "Linux LUKS" keeps exactly
one thing responsible for opening it: the `rd.luks.*` kernel arguments below.

**Why not `bootc install to-disk --block-setup tpm2-luks`.** It exists, and it
would have been three words instead of a branch. Read what it does: it binds
the unlock to *"presence of the default tpm2 device"* — no passphrase slot, no
recovery slot — and on systemd 258 `--tpm2-device=auto` binds to **no PCRs at
all** (measured on real hardware; L-002 round 31). That is an encrypted disk
with one key, held by a chip that a firmware update, a TPM clear or a
motherboard swap takes away. It is the stranding case, spelled as a flag.
bootc's own help points at `to-filesystem` for LUKS.

---

## The keys, and the order they are created in

1. `cryptsetup luksFormat --type luks2 --pbkdf argon2id`, passphrase on stdin.
   Never on a command line: argv is world-readable in `/proc`.
2. `/usr/libexec/apex-luks-enroll --device <dev> --recovery-out <file>`, run out
   of the **image being installed**, not the live environment — enrolment policy
   belongs to the system it applies to. The existing passphrase is offered both
   as `$PASSWORD` (systemd-cryptenroll's own variable) and on stdin.
3. The installer then **proves both keys open the volume** with `cryptsetup
   open --test-passphrase`, before the ten-minute `bootc install` starts. A
   recovery key that was printed but does not work is worse than none, and
   finding that out afterwards means finding it out on the user's machine.
4. Whether a TPM keyslot exists is **observed in the header**
   (`cryptsetup luksDump` → `systemd-tpm2` token), never taken on trust. Only
   then is `rd.luks.options=<uuid>=tpm2-device=auto` added.

**One path runs step 2 later than you would expect, and it says so here rather
than only in the code.** On a *network* install of a machine with nowhere to
stage the download — no second drive, no spare partition, so APEX-OS is
downloaded onto the target disk as it installs — the enrolment helper lives in
an image that is not on the machine yet. Steps 2 to 4 therefore happen after
that download instead of before it: the order is luksFormat, open, mkfs, mount,
download, then enrol, prove and show. Nothing of the user's is at risk during
the gap — the volume holds only blobs that can be fetched again, the passphrase
they just typed has already opened it, and the key still reaches them before
`bootc` writes the first byte of the system. Running the helper any earlier
pulled ~15 GB into the live ISO's RAM overlay, on the one machine shape that
path exists for.

If the helper is missing from the image, fails, produces no recovery key, or
produces one that does not open the volume, the install **refuses** — with the
disk carrying no data, so nothing is locked away. An encrypted disk whose only
key is one passphrase is one forgotten password away from being a brick.

---

## The recovery key: where it goes and how to use it

It reaches the user by two routes, because each fails differently.

1. **On screen.** The engine emits `APEX-INSTALL-RECOVERY-KEY: <key>` on
   stdout. The graphical installer captures that line, keeps it out of the
   scrolling install log, and shows it on the final page in large monospace —
   with a checkbox that must be ticked before **Reboot now** is enabled. A user
   who reboots past it never sees it again: the installer's RAM disk goes with
   the reboot.
2. **On the USB stick they booted from**, as a 0600
   `apex-recovery-key-<hostname>.txt` on the live ISO's own ESP. The file says,
   in as many words, that a stick in the same bag as the laptop protects
   nothing, and to move the key elsewhere and delete it.

It is **never** written to the target's ESP or `/boot`. Those live on the
machine that is encrypted, and an attacker holding the laptop has them.
It is **never** passed through `note()` or `log()`: the install log is copied
onto the stick in the clear on every failure.

**Why the recovery key survives a wrong keyboard.** systemd's recovery key is
written in a modhex alphabet whose characters sit in the same place on QWERTY,
QWERTZ and AZERTY. So it is also the answer to "the console keymap is wrong" —
it can be typed on a machine whose layout is not the owner's.

---

## The keyboard, which is the other way to be locked out

The passphrase prompt is a **kernel console prompt**. It has one keymap, no
input method, no compose key and no way back. Two separate defects made that
prompt lie about which keyboard it was using.

**1. `/etc/vconsole.conf` was given an XKB layout name.** `loadkeys` does not
speak XKB. Measured against the keymap tree the image ships: of the 99 layouts
`xkeyboard-config` offers, **36 are not loadable console keymap names**.
`loadkeys` then fails and the console silently keeps the kernel's built-in map,
which is `us`. The installer now converts through systemd's own
`/usr/share/systemd/kbd-model-map`, preferring a keymap file of that exact name
when one exists (which is the order systemd itself uses), and validating the
table's answer against the keymap tree before writing it — the table names a
`ge` keymap that Fedora 43's kbd does not ship. After conversion, **0 of 99**
resolve to something `loadkeys` cannot load.

**2. Nothing put the choice where the initramfs could read it.** The initramfs
is built **in the image, at build time, `--no-hostonly`**, so it cannot contain
this machine's `/etc/vconsole.conf` and is identical on every machine. The one
per-machine channel that exists today is the kernel command line:
`systemd-vconsole-setup`, which runs inside the initrd, parses
`vconsole.keymap=` from `/proc/cmdline` (verified by reading the strings of the
binary the image ships, and by the `i18n` dracut module delegating to it rather
than installing its own cmdline hook). So an encrypted install now gets

```
vconsole.keymap=<console keymap>   rd.vconsole.keymap=<console keymap>
```

added, and **only when the resolved console keymap is not exactly `us`**. The
guard is on the console keymap, not on the XKB layout: `us` + `dvorak` resolves
to `us-dvorak` and does get the argument, because that owner's fingers really
do produce different characters. Only a machine that lands on plain `us` — the
kernel's built-in — gains no argument that could later override
`localectl set-keymap`.

On an encrypted machine the kernel argument is therefore the source of truth
for the console keymap, and `/etc/vconsole.conf` says so in a comment. That is
deliberate: changing only the file would leave the *unlock* prompt on the old
layout, which is the lockout this exists to prevent.

### The seam for systemd-boot and UKIs

A UKI carries its command line inside the signed PE, and `systemd-stub` ignores
a command line handed to it by the boot loader when Secure Boot is on. So the
`--karg` route above stops being per-machine the moment APEX pivots to
sd-boot + UKIs.

The replacement that needs no re-signing is a **system credential**:
`systemd-vconsole-setup.service` carries `ImportCredential=vconsole.*`, and both
`systemd-boot` (`\loader\credentials\*.cred`) and `systemd-stub`
(`\EFI\Linux\<uki>.efi.extra.d\*.cred`) pass credentials from the ESP into the
initrd.

**This is settled and built, and it took one measurement to find out that the
obvious version of it does not work.**

`systemd-vconsole-setup(8)`, about the `vconsole.keymap` credential: *"The
matching options in vconsole.conf and on the kernel command line take
precedence over these credentials."* APEX's image ships `/etc/vconsole.conf`
with `KEYMAP=us`, and dracut's i18n module copies that file **into the
initramfs**. So the credential arrives, loses to a baked-in `us`, and a `.cred`
on the ESP on its own is **inert**. That is not a deduction from the manual: a
guest was booted with the credential and nothing else, the credential is
visible in its `/run/credentials/@system`, its `/etc/vconsole.conf` still says
`KEYMAP=us`, and the unlock was refused.

Three pieces make it work, and each is measured by
`installer/test-installer-keymap-boot.sh`:

| piece | file | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the credential on the ESP | `installer/apex-install` | writes `loader/credentials/vconsole.keymap.cred` on every encrypted install, alongside the karg. GRUB ignores it; a machine installed today needs no migration when the pivot happens |
| the shim that makes it count | `files/dracut/apex-unlock-hint/apex-vconsole-credential` | runs `Before=systemd-vconsole-setup.service`, pulled in by `sysinit.target.wants`, and writes the credential's value into the **initramfs's own** `/etc/vconsole.conf` — a tmpfs, gone at switch-root. Nothing on disk is touched |
| the precedence guard | the same script's first loop | a kernel command line that already sets `vconsole.keymap=` wins, and the shim says so and exits. Every machine installed before the pivot keeps working exactly as it does now |

The `.wants` directory is load-bearing and `Containerfile.apex` asserts it by
name. `systemd-vconsole-setup` is ordered `Before=sysinit.target`, so a unit
pulled in by `initrd.target.wants` — which is where this module's other unit
lives — would run long after the keymap it is trying to set had been loaded.
That failure is completely silent; it shows up as an owner who cannot type
their passphrase.

A **UKI addon** contributing a `.cmdline` section remains the other candidate,
and it is a better one in one respect: an addon is signed, and a `.cred` on the
ESP of a machine without Secure Boot is writable by anyone who can reach the
disk. The shim validates the credential as a keymap name for that reason and
drops anything else. If `sdboot-image` settles on addons instead, the
installer's side is one function and the shim becomes dead weight rather than
wrong.

---

## What is refused, and why

Every one of these fires **before anything is written**, and says so.

| case | what happens |
|------|--------------|
| `encrypt=` missing from the answers file | refused. Not "defaults to no" — a dropped key would silently produce an unencrypted machine — and not "defaults to yes", which would encrypt CI disks. |
| `encrypt=yes` with `mode=partition` | refused: one partition has nowhere to put an unencrypted `/boot`. The user is told to choose whole-disk or turn encryption off. |
| a passphrase with a character outside printable ASCII | refused: the boot prompt has no accents, no emoji and no input method. The **login** password is not restricted. |
| a passphrase shorter than 8 characters | refused. |
| `encrypt=yes` with a non-btrfs root | refused: an untested combination is not something to discover on somebody's only disk. |
| `cryptsetup`, `sgdisk`, `mkfs.*` or dm-crypt missing | refused, naming what is missing and offering the unencrypted route. |
| the image has no `/usr/libexec/apex-luks-enroll` | refused, naming the path. |
| the target already carries a `crypto_LUKS` header (partition mode) | refused, exactly as before. That guard is unchanged. |
| unattended (`apex.unattended`, test builds only) with `apex.encrypt=yes` | refused: that path has nobody to show a recovery key to. |

## Recovering a machine you cannot get into

1. **The passphrase is refused and you are sure it is right.** The keyboard is
   probably not the one you think. Type the **recovery key** instead, at the
   same prompt — its letters are in the same place on nearly every layout.
2. **You have lost the passphrase.** The recovery key. It is on the USB stick
   you installed from, unless you deleted it, and it was on the last screen of
   the installer.
3. **Automatic (TPM) unlocking stopped working** after a firmware update, a TPM
   clear or a motherboard swap. The passphrase still works; if it does not, the
   recovery key does. `docs/boot-v2.md` has the measured behaviour of each of
   those cases.
4. **You have neither key.** There is no fourth option, and there is not
   supposed to be. That is what the acknowledgement checkbox on the last
   installer screen is for.

Once inside, `sudo systemd-cryptenroll --recovery-key /dev/<partition>` makes a
new recovery key, and `cryptsetup luksChangeKey` changes the passphrase.

---

## What this does not do yet

* **No TPM enrolment is exercised by the installer's own tests.** The installer
  calls the helper and checks what came back; whether a TPM keyslot is safe is
  `apex-luks-enroll`'s decision and `docs/boot-v2.md`'s evidence.
* **A passphrase has been typed at a real unlock prompt; a disk this installer
  produced has still never been booted.** Those are two different claims and
  the difference matters.

  `installer/test-installer-keymap-boot.sh` boots the shipped initramfs against
  a real LUKS2 volume and types the passphrase on an emulated keyboard, so the
  keymap property is measured as an owner experiences it: the same key
  positions unlock the volume on `de` and are refused on `us`. What that guest
  does **not** use is a disk this installer partitioned — it is a bare volume,
  reached by a direct kernel boot with no firmware and no bootloader.

  So the chain bootloader → initramfs → unlock → ostree pivot → login has not
  been exercised on an installer-built disk. That boot belongs to
  `files/scripts/boot-v2/run-scenarios`, and is requested there.
* **In-place encryption of an existing install is not offered**, and should not
  be: `cryptsetup reencrypt` on a live root is the single most dangerous thing
  this installer could learn to do.
