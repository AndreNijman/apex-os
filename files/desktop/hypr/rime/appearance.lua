-- ── Motion ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- The compositor moves on the same beats and curves as Rime Shell (UI/UX
-- roadmap v3 Phase 20, retuned 2026-09-26 with the shell's fluid motion, and
-- 2026-09-27 onto real springs), so a window opening and a panel opening read
-- as one system. The curves are the shell's own tokens (rime-shell
-- src/theme/motion.js, at the default "balanced" speed); a speed here is in
-- tenths of a second. The shell scales every one of them by its own speed
-- setting at runtime (hyprMotion.js).
--
-- Andre, 2026-09-27: "make the … hyprland window animations cleaner and sleek,
-- not just fading." Measured in a nested Hyprland 0.56.2 with alacritty, the
-- 2026-09-26 tuning was mostly a fade: a window's first frame was already 95 %
-- of its size and 61 % opaque, and a close faded over the whole of its 280 ms
-- while shrinking by only a tenth. Now the SIZE carries the change:
--
--   arriving  grows from 80 % on a spring, opaque within 180 ms     rimeArrive
--   leaving   shrinks to 85 %, gathering speed, gone in 200 ms      emphasizedAccel
--             its opacity held until the end                     exitFade
--   moving    a tile glides to its place, velocity kept            rimeGlide
--   a switch  the workspace slides, and stops without a crawl      rimePage
--   fading    Core Animation's ease, no hard edge                  effects
--
-- A spring is not a curve over a duration. Hyprland steps it in real time and
-- it finishes when it is at rest, so a window moved again half-way keeps its
-- velocity instead of restarting from rest and kinking; `speed` does not time
-- it. On a spring leaf `speed` is the spring's response (its undamped period,
-- in tenths of a second): Hyprland ignores it, and the shell scales it with
-- the curve so it can tell its own push from a reload.
--
-- Exits stay on a curve. A spring finishes only when it is still (Hyprland's
-- rest threshold, about 0.7 s for these), and a closing window lives until its
-- animation ends.
--
-- hyprlang carried these as `bezier =` / `animation =` keys; each is its own
-- call now, `enabled / speed / curve` becoming named fields.

-- A closing window's opacity: Material 3's own emphasized-accelerate, harder

-- The springs. Parameterised as the shell's are (motion.js SPRINGS): a
-- response in seconds and a damping fraction, 1 landing without overshoot and
-- below it with a whisper of one. Hyprland takes mass, stiffness and damping
-- instead; with mass 1, stiffness = (2π / response)² and dampening =
-- 2 · damping · √stiffness. (The key is `dampening`: this Hyprland rejects
-- `damping`, whatever its wiki says.)
--
-- Each is also kept in RIME_SPRINGS, a global the shell's own `hyprctl eval`
-- can read: Hyprland reports a spring leaf as "spring:<name>" and nothing
-- more, so this table is how the shell scales a spring by its speed setting
-- (stiffness / s², dampening / s: the same motion, s times slower) without
-- a copy of these numbers of its own.
