//! Update channels, staged rollout, and the health signal that stops one.
//! Roadmap §26.
//!
//! Pure: no files, no processes, no network. The CLI measures the machine and
//! hands the measurements in, the same division `blueprint` and `task` use.
//!
//! ## What a channel is here
//!
//! A tag on one repository. `ghcr.io/andrenijman/apex-os:stable` and
//! `…:edge` name different digests of the same image, and which one a machine
//! follows is the `container-image-reference` in its deployment origin —
//! written at install time, changed by `bootc switch`. So a channel is not a
//! new build tier, a new edition, or a second update mechanism: it is which
//! tag `bootc upgrade` resolves.
//!
//! ## Every APEX machine is already on edge, and has never been told so
//!
//! `apex`, `daily`, `gaming-mesa` and `gaming-nvidia` are four names for one
//! digest, and `build-image.yml` moves all four on every successful build of
//! `main`. That is the definition of an edge channel. Andre's L16 follows
//! `:daily`. [`from_tag`] therefore maps those four to [`Channel::Edge`] and
//! keeps the alias, so `apex channel status` can say "tracking `daily`, which
//! moves with every build — that is the edge channel under an older name"
//! instead of "unknown". Reporting a machine's real state is the entire value
//! of this surface, and those four tags must go on meaning what they mean:
//! they are what installed machines track, and a tag that stops moving does
//! not error, it silently stops delivering security updates.
//!
//! ## Which direction is dangerous
//!
//! Moving toward `edge` takes a newer image, which is an ordinary update.
//! Moving toward `stable` usually takes an OLDER one, and that is the direction
//! that needs care for the reason §25 exists: `/usr` goes back and the state
//! the newer build migrated does not. [`Direction::Behind`] is the flag for
//! that, and the CLI pins the current deployment and prints §25's rollback
//! table before it switches.
//!
//! ## Staged rollout, without inventing a server
//!
//! A machine derives a stable bucket from its own `/etc/machine-id`
//! ([`bucket`]) and takes a release only when its bucket falls inside the
//! release's percentage ([`admits`]). The bucket never leaves the machine — it
//! is one of a hundred values, and it is not in the report `apex channel
//! report` would send.
//!
//! The percentage has to live somewhere that can change between builds — 1,
//! then 5, then 25 — and an OCI label is baked once per image, so a label
//! cannot be it. The pointer is a **signed rollout document**, published as its
//! own object in the same registry under the `rollout` tag and re-published
//! whenever the number moves. [`RolloutDoc`] is that document and
//! [`decide_rollout`] is the whole of what a machine does with one.
//!
//! Why the registry rather than a service: the machine already contacts that
//! registry on every update, so the document costs no new host, no new trust
//! root, and no new fact about the machine that anybody can observe. APEX
//! operates no server and this does not ask it to. The cost is stated in
//! `docs/update-channels.md`: a document in a registry is a **broadcast**, so
//! a ramp is per-channel and never per-machine, and there is no back channel —
//! the operator learns nothing about who took what except from the opt-in
//! health report, which is off by default.
//!
//! There is no second source. A machine that cannot reach the document, cannot
//! read it, or holds one that does not apply to it reaches everybody — which is
//! what every APEX image published so far does. An image label was named here
//! as a fallback for a while and was never stamped by anything; it is gone,
//! because a fallback the registry serves is no use to a machine that could not
//! reach the registry, and a percentage that reaches the gate without a
//! signature over it is the one thing this must not have.
