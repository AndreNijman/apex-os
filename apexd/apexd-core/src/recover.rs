//! Recovery, repair and factory-reset policy (roadmap §19), as pure data.
//!
//! Nothing here touches a filesystem. The CLI does the probing, the resolving
//! and the deleting; this module owns the three tables that decide *what* is
//! allowed to happen, because each of them is a policy that has to be
//! reviewable in one place and testable without a machine:
//!
//! * [`ROWS`] — the recovery surface §19 asks for, and the state vocabulary
//!   every row reports in.
//! * [`REPAIRS`] — the steps `[Repair automatically]` is allowed to run. The
//!   invariant is enforced by a test, not by a comment: **a step is eligible
//!   for automatic repair only if it is idempotent and removes no data.**
//! * [`targets`] — the reset ladder, and therefore the exact data boundary of
//!   the most destructive verb in the product.
//!
//! ## Why the reset boundary is a table and not a code path
//!
//! §19's own words are "allow a refresh/reset path that is explicit about what
//! user data is preserved". A reset whose scope is spread across `if` branches
//! cannot be read, cannot be diffed, and cannot be asserted. So every path a
//! reset will ever touch is one row of a `const` table carrying its scope, its
//! disposition and a sentence a human can check — and the suite asserts
//! properties over the whole table rather than over the one case somebody
//! remembered to write.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately NOT in the table
//!
//! * **Anything under `/etc`.** `/etc` on an APEX machine holds `passwd`,
//!   `shadow`, `fstab`, `crypttab` and the NetworkManager connections. ostree
//!   three-way-merges it against the deployment, and there is no runtime verb
//!   that restores it to image state without deploying. A reset that emptied
//!   it would produce a machine that does not boot or cannot be logged into,
//!   and the thing that would undo it is what it broke. Restoring `/etc` is a
//!   reinstall; `docs/recovery.md` says so rather than this table pretending
//!   otherwise.
//! * **Anything under `/var/lib/apex`.** The package extension, the model
//!   store and the boot-health records each have a program that owns them
//!   (`apex-pkg`, `apex ai`, `apex-boot-health`). Deleting `pkg/state.json`
//!   under a merged system extension leaves `/usr` carrying packages APEX can
//!   no longer name — a worse state than the one the user was trying to leave.
//!   The machine-level operations are the verbs that already exist, and
//!   `apex recover status` names them.
//! * **The capsule records under `~/.local/share/apex/env`.** Each one names a
//!   real rootless container. Deleting the record orphans the container:
//!   `apex env list` would show nothing while `podman ps -a` still shows them,
//!   and APEX would have lost the name it needs to remove them. `apex env rm`
//!   is the verb for that, and it is named in the preserved list.
//! * **Anything under `~/.config/hypr` as a deletion.** `hyprland.conf`
//!   `source=`s `apex-input.conf` and `apex-display.conf`, and Hyprland treats
//!   a `source=` with no match as a FATAL config error — verified against the
//!   image's own Hyprland, which is why `apex-shell-firstrun` pre-creates both
//!   as empty files. So those two are **truncated** to the empty state the
//!   provisioner itself seeds, never removed, and every other file in that
//!   directory is preserved. A one-line edit to a live compositor config has
//!   already cost this project a desktop once.
