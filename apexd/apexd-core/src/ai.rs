//! Local inference as an OS service (roadmap §14): schema, validation, and the
//! pure planners.
//!
//! §14 asks for `apex ai models`, `apex ai pull qwen3-coder`, `apex ai run`, and
//! behind them:
//!
//! > Expose one APEX local-inference service/API to applications. […] Abstract
//! > runtimes such as llama.cpp, Ollama, vLLM or future engines. […] Manage
//! > model storage, VRAM, idle unloading, CPU/GPU backend selection and power
//! > use. […] Support CUDA, ROCm, Vulkan and CPU inference where appropriate.
//! > […] Allow agent clients to use local inference through the same service.
//! > […] Think of it as a shared system service similar in spirit to PipeWire,
//! > but for model inference.
//!
//! Nothing in this module performs I/O. It owns the model-id and digest
//! vocabulary, the store layout, the catalogue and manifest formats, the
//! backend-selection policy, the VRAM fit arithmetic, the idle-unload decision
//! and the runtime argv planner. `apex-aid` and `apex ai` do the reading,
//! writing and spawning.
//!
//! ── THE DECISION THIS MODULE EXISTS TO RECORD: per-user, not system ─────────
//!
//! "A shared system service similar in spirit to PipeWire" is the roadmap's
//! phrasing, and it is worth noticing that **PipeWire is itself a per-user
//! session daemon** — `pipewire.service` is a `systemd --user` unit. What makes
//! PipeWire feel like a system service is that it is *the one* endpoint every
//! application talks to and that it arbitrates a contended device. Neither of
//! those requires running as root or serving every account from one process.
//!
//! So there were two candidate shapes:
//!
//! **(a) One system daemon, shared socket.** One `apex-aid.service` under
//! `systemd`, one socket in `/run`, every user's requests handled by one
//! process. Rejected. Three reasons, in order of how badly each fails:
//!
//! 1. **It puts every user's prompts in one address space.** A prompt is the
//!    most private thing a person types into a computer — it contains the code
//!    they are debugging, the mail they are drafting, the question they would
//!    not ask a colleague. A single process serving several accounts makes
//!    "user A's context reached user B's session" a bug away rather than
//!    impossible: one mistake in request routing, one reused KV-cache slot, one
//!    shared prompt-cache file, and the leak is silent because nothing on the
//!    machine is watching for it. Per-user, the kernel enforces the boundary
//!    and no code of ours has to be right for it to hold.
//! 2. **It is a privileged daemon whose entire job is untrusted content.**
//!    `AGENTS.md`'s agent-runtime rules are emphatic that `apex-agentd` stays
//!    unprivileged and per-user *because* it handles untrusted model output. A
//!    local inference service does not merely handle model output — it
//!    generates it, from prompt text it also did not write. That is the same
//!    argument one step earlier in the pipeline, and it points the same way.
//! 3. **It would need an authorisation story APEX is forbidden to build.**
//!    `AGENTS.md` bans giving this a polkit action or a system-bus name. A
//!    system daemon with no authorisation model and a socket several users can
//!    open is worse than either.
//!
//! **(b) A per-user daemon with a shared, read-only model store.** Chosen.
//! `apex-aid` is a `systemd --user` unit, opt-in exactly as `apex-agentd` is,
//! and its two endpoints are Unix sockets at mode `0600` inside a `0700`
//! directory in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, whose peer credentials are checked with
//! `SO_PEERCRED` anyway. The weights — the only genuinely large, genuinely
//! shareable part — live once under [`STORE_ROOT`], root-owned and
//! world-readable, written only by `sudo apex ai pull`.
//!
//! Tested against the questions that decide it:
//!
//! * *Can user A's prompt or context reach user B's session?* No. There is no
//!   process, socket, file or directory that both sessions can open. A's daemon
//!   runs as A, its sockets are in A's `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (itself `0700`), and
//!   the only shared object is a read-only file of weights.
//! * *Is a localhost TCP OpenAI-compatible endpoint reachable by a local user
//!   you did not intend?* Yes, always, and that is why APEX does not offer one.
//!   `SO_PEERCRED` exists on Unix sockets only; a TCP connection carries no
//!   credential at all, so `127.0.0.1:11434` is open to every uid on the box,
//!   to every Flatpak that holds the network permission, and to anything that
//!   can persuade a browser to issue a request. The setting is *recognised in
//!   order to be refused* — see [`Settings::validate`] and
//!   [`refuse_tcp_endpoint`] — rather than merely undocumented.
//! * *What happens on a multi-user box?* Each account gets its own daemon and
//!   its own backend process, sharing the weights. Which is correct for
//!   privacy and is also where the one real limitation lives:
//!
//! ── STATED LIMITATION: VRAM is not arbitrated across users ─────────────────
//!
//! VRAM is genuinely contended and this design does not arbitrate it between
//! accounts. Within one user the daemon serialises: it holds at most one
//! backend process, and loading a second model unloads the first
//! ([`plan_idle`], [`Fit`]). Across users it cannot, because the thing that
//! could — one privileged process that sees every session's allocation — is
//! precisely the system daemon rejected above.
//!
//! The concrete failure is ordinary and survivable: the second user's backend
//! fails to allocate and reports it, and [`plan_fit`] is what turns that into a
//! smaller offload rather than a crash, because it plans against *free* VRAM
//! read at launch time and not against the card's total. What is lost is
//! fairness — first come, first served, with no queue and no eviction.
//!
//! This is recorded rather than fixed because the trade is not close for
//! APEX's target. A Daily or Gaming machine has one interactive user; the case
//! that would benefit is a shared workstation with two people generating at
//! once, and buying fairness for it would cost every single-user machine a
//! privileged daemon holding everyone's prompts. If that case ever matters, the
//! honest fix is a *small* system arbiter that hands out VRAM leases and never
//! sees a prompt — not moving inference into root.
//!
//! ── Backends are not in the image, and this module never installs one ──────
//!
//! llama.cpp with CUDA is gigabytes. `Containerfile.core` is the slow-moving
//! tier and a rebuild there costs the whole fleet a multi-gigabyte update, so
//! no inference runtime is baked in. P1 already built the two mechanisms that
//! serve this, and `AGENTS.md` forbids inventing a third:
//!
//! * `sudo apex install <runtime>` — a system extension overlaid on `/usr`,
//!   which is how a CPU or Vulkan build of `llama-server` arrives;
//! * `apex env create cuda` — a capsule with the NVIDIA driver passed through,
//!   which is how a CUDA build arrives without putting CUDA on the host.
//!
//! [`Runtime::install_hint`] is the whole of APEX's involvement: it returns the
//! exact command to type. Nothing here, and nothing in the daemon, downloads a
//! runtime.
//!
//! ── Where a model comes from, and what "verify by digest" actually proves ───
//!
//! A digest check proves the bytes that arrived match the digest you compared
//! them to. It proves nothing about *what you asked for* if the name-to-digest
//! mapping came over the same network. So the mapping is not fetched:
//!
//! | spec | mapping comes from | trust anchor |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `qwen3-coder` | [`Catalogue`] at [`CATALOGUE_PATH`], shipped in the image | the image is cosign-signed and digest-pinned in CI |
//! | `<url> --digest sha256:<hex>` | the person typing it | the user, explicitly |
//! | `<url>` with no digest | nowhere | **refused** — see [`PullError::NoDigest`] |
//!
//! There is deliberately no trust-on-first-use path. Pinning whatever the first
//! download happened to be and re-checking it afterwards would make every
//! subsequent verification pass while proving only that the file had not
//! changed since a moment nobody was watching.
//!
//! ── The store, and why the inference process cannot write to it ────────────
//!
//! ```text
//! /var/lib/apex/ai/
//!   models/blobs/sha256-<64 hex>   0444 root:root   the weights
//!   models/manifests/<id>.json     0444 root:root   id -> digest, and what it is
//!   staging/                       0700 root:root   download target; verified, then renamed
//! ```
//!
//! Root-owned and mode `0444`, so the backend — which runs as the user, loads
//! untrusted weights and speaks a network protocol — cannot alter a model, its
//! own or anyone else's. `/usr` is read-only so the store cannot live there, and
//! `/var` is where machine-local mutable state belongs.
//!
//! A blob is **verified in staging and then renamed** into `blobs/`. The rename
//! is atomic within a filesystem, so a partially written or wrong-digest file
//! is never visible under its final content-addressed name — the failure mode
//! that would otherwise make a corrupt download look like a cached model
//! forever.
//!
//! ── The two kinds of state, kept apart ─────────────────────────────────────
//!
//! [`crate::gameprofile`]'s rule, applied once more: state written only in
//! response to an explicit user command is user-owned and hand-editable;
//! anything a program produces on its own is generated and lives elsewhere.
//!
//! | file | kind | unknown keys |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `~/.config/apex/ai.toml` ([`Settings`]) | desired, user-owned | refused — one program writer, so an unknown key is a typo |
//! | `models/manifests/<id>.json` ([`Manifest`]) | generated | kept |
//!
//! The manifest keeps unknown keys for a reason `games.toml` does not have:
//! `bootc rollback` exists. A model pulled by version N of `apex` is read by
//! version N-1 after a rollback, so a field the reading build does not
//! recognise is a newer writer, not a mistake — the same argument
//! [`crate::host::HostCaps`] makes for a probe cache.

// Two endpoints, and the split is the design rather than a convenience:
//
// * [`API_SOCKET`] carries the **backend's own HTTP API, unmodified**. The
//   daemon relays bytes and parses nothing, which is what lets an
//   OpenAI-compatible client — an editor plugin, an agent, `curl` — connect
//   with no APEX-specific handshake. It is also why the daemon needs no HTTP
//   implementation of its own: a proxy that parsed requests would be a second
//   HTTP stack to keep correct, and every header it failed to forward would be
//   a bug in somebody else's client.
// * [`CONTROL_SOCKET`] carries the types below, one JSON object per line, in
//   the same shape as `apex_agent_core::protocol`. It exists because "which
//   model is loaded, on which backend, with how much VRAM" is an APEX question
//   that no backend API answers.
//
// The framing is line-based, so a serialised request or response must never
// contain a raw newline. `serde_json` escapes them inside strings, and
// `no_message_can_contain_a_raw_newline` asserts it over a message built from
// hostile text rather than trusting that.
