//! The relay path, end to end, against a relay that is not Cloudflare's.
//!
//! ## Why a double and not a deployment
//!
//! The relay this is written for is a Cloudflare Worker plus a Durable
//! Object, and deploying one is a decision about somebody's account and
//! somebody's money. It is not a thing a test suite gets to do, and a suite
//! that needed it would be a suite that never runs.
//!
//! So the relay here is a `TcpListener` on loopback that implements the same
//! room protocol the Worker under `relay/` implements: two roles on a
//! rendezvous id, one waiting host, an opaque byte copy once they are joined.
//! It is the same shape `apex-secretd`'s Cloudflare provider uses for the
//! API — a loopback double that refuses anything the real thing would refuse
//! — and it buys the same thing: every claim below is about code that ran.
//!
//! **The double is an independent implementation on purpose.** It does not
//! use `apex_remote_core::relay`'s codec. If it did, a codec that masked
//! wrongly or framed a length wrongly would agree with itself and the suite
//! would prove nothing about the wire.
//!
//! ## What it is allowed to conclude, and what it is not
//!
//! It concludes that the client speaks the protocol, that the desktop is
//! reachable through a relay it dialled outbound, that the relay carries
//! ciphertext, and that a relayed session is labelled as one. It does **not**
//! conclude that the TypeScript Worker is correct — that needs `wrangler dev`
//! and is written down in the card as the pre-deploy step.
