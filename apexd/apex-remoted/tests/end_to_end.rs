//! The whole chain, against real processes: a device, `apex-remoted` and
//! `apex-agentd`.
//!
//! Everything else about this protocol is a pure function over values and is
//! tested beside the code. Three claims cannot be made about a value, and
//! they are the three that decide whether any of this works:
//!
//! * a device that scans a pairing code can complete a `Noise_NK` handshake
//!   against the real service and end up in the real store;
//! * a paired device can open a `Noise_IK` session and get an answer from the
//!   real `apex-agentd` through the real proxy;
//! * **a request that arrives this way is recorded as
//!   `claude-remote-control`, by the device's id, and cannot approve a root
//!   operation** — while the same daemon, asked directly from this test
//!   process, can. That last comparison is the point: "the remote request was
//!   refused" proves nothing unless a local one is allowed by the same daemon
//!   in the same run.
//!
//! Both daemons get their own `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and `XDG_STATE_HOME`, so
//! nothing here touches a running `apex-agentd` or the user's own devices.
//! Both are killed by pid; nothing goes looking for a process by name.
