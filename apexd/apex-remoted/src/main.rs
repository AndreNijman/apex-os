//! `apex-remoted` — the desktop half of APEX Remote (roadmap §46, P1-050).
//!
//! Per-user, unprivileged, and deliberately a second daemon rather than a
//! feature of `apex-agentd`. Three reasons, in order of how much they matter:
//!
//! * **It is the only thing here that listens on a network.** `apex-agentd`
//!   binds a Unix socket in a 0700 directory and nothing else; giving it a TCP
//!   listener would put an attack surface on the process that owns every
//!   agent PTY on the machine. A separate process can be stopped, can fail,
//!   and can be compromised without taking the agent runtime with it.
//! * **It has a different lifetime.** `apex agent enable` starts the runtime
//!   for somebody who is going to run an agent locally, and most of them never
//!   pair a phone. `apex remote enable` is a separate decision.
//! * **It is a client of the runtime, not a part of it.** Everything it does
//!   goes through the same control socket `apex` uses, under an origin the
//!   daemon assigns. If this process is taken over, what the attacker gets is
//!   a `claude-remote-control` origin — no root approvals, no break-glass, no
//!   raw secrets — and not the runtime's own privileges.
//!
//! ## What it will not do
//!
//! Start unless this process is a systemd user service. A proxy started from
//! a login session is classified `local-terminal` by everything it connects
//! to, and §7 reserves approving a root operation for exactly that. The
//! per-connection origin latch in `apex-agentd` closes the hole properly;
//! this refuses to rely on one guard for it. `--allow-foreground` is there
//! for a developer running it by hand, and it says what it is giving up.

                      raising it past two minutes is refused, because the
                      deadline is what stops an idle connection holding a
                      thread on the only network listener in the stack.
  --relay <url>       the rendezvous to fall back to when no LAN path works
  --ping-interval-ms  how often an open connection is measured (default 15000)

  --allow-foreground  run outside a systemd user unit (see below)
  --help

This service is normally started by systemd:

  apex remote enable

It refuses to run from a login session, because `apex-agentd` would then
classify every request it forwards as a human at this machine. Pass
--allow-foreground to override that for development; the requests it forwards
are still recorded as claude-remote-control, because it declares that on every
connection, but the second guard is gone.
