//! The desktop half of push: watching the daemon, and posting envelopes.
//!
//! ## Why this watcher exists on the desktop at all
//!
//! There is one already, on the phone: `AlertWatcher` in `android/core` folds
//! successive polls into alerts. It cannot be the only one, and the reason is
//! the whole point of P1-058 — it runs inside the app, and the app is not
//! running. A phone in a pocket with the screen off has no poll loop, and an
//! agent that needs somebody at two in the morning reaches nobody.
//!
//! So the rules are implemented a second time, here, where the process is
//! always alive. That is a duplication and it is a real cost; it is paid
//! deliberately, and the two are kept honest by the same device `wire.rs` uses
//! against the hand-rolled Kotlin Noise — committed vectors that both suites
//! read. The rules themselves are stated in one place, in
//! `apex_remote_core::push`, and this module is the observation.
//!
//! ## The rules, which are `AlertWatcher`'s rules
//!
//! * **The first observation raises nothing.** A daemon restarting to six
//!   sessions that have been waiting since yesterday must not push six
//!   notifications for things that did not just happen.
//! * **Only the transition edge.** `Session::set_state` has no same-state
//!   early return and four independent paths publish `waiting_for_user` for
//!   one turn — the notification hook, the stop hook, the PTY BEL/OSC scanner
//!   and the ten-second idle rule — so keying on "is waiting" would push four
//!   times. Keying on "became waiting" pushes once.
//! * **A pruned session is forgotten.** Ids are reused after a prune, and a
//!   new session landing on a recycled id must not be diffed against a
//!   stranger's state.
//!
//! ## Why `worktrees` is on a slower timer than `list`
//!
//! Answering `worktrees` runs git in every remembered project and does a
//! `merge-tree --write-tree` per worktree. The Android client deliberately
//! keeps it off its four-second loop for that reason, and the consequence
//! recorded against P1-058 was that a TEST_FAILED alert could only fire across
//! two manual refreshes of the Projects screen.
//!
//! Here it is on its own timer, so that window becomes [`WORKTREE_INTERVAL`]
//! rather than "whenever somebody opens a screen". That is a real improvement
//! and it is still not instant; it is stated as a number rather than as
//! "supported".
//!
//! ## What this module will not do
//!
//! Read a session's `detail`, `cwd`, `project`, `worktree`, `args` or
//! telemetry. It has the whole `SessionInfo` in its hand — it must, to see the
//! state — and it puts none of it in an envelope, because
//! `apex_remote_core::push::Body` has nowhere to put it. That is checked by a
//! test that drives a session carrying a password through this watcher and
//! asserts the password is in none of the bytes that leave the machine.
