//! Forwarding a device's frames into `apex-agentd`, with an origin it can
//! trust.
//!
//! ## The rule, and it is the only rule that matters here
//!
//! **Every connection this module opens to `apex-agentd` sends
//! `DeclareOrigin` first, and refuses to send anything else if that fails.**
//!
//! `apex-remoted` is not a managed session, so the daemon classifies it from
//! its own cgroup. As a systemd user unit that is `scheduled-job` — not
//! local, so it cannot approve a root operation, which is right by accident.
//! Started any other way it is `local-terminal`, and then every request this
//! process forwards for a phone is filed as a human at the keyboard. The
//! declaration is what makes the origin a property of *what this connection
//! is carrying* rather than of how the process happened to be started.
//!
//! The daemon checks it: `apex_agent_core::origin::may_declare` refuses any
//! declaration that is not a narrowing, and refuses the two local origins by
//! name whatever was observed. So this cannot launder a remote request into a
//! local one even if it tried, and a build of the daemon that predates the
//! connection latch answers `permission_denied` — loudly, which is why
//! [`Agentd::open`] treats that as fatal rather than carrying on.
//!
//! ## Why one agentd connection per control frame
//!
//! The daemon serves one connection per thread and reads one request per
//! line. Sharing a single connection between a phone's control traffic and
//! its terminals would serialise them behind each other: a `list` that
//! arrived while an `attach` was streaming would wait for the terminal to
//! close. A connection per control frame costs a `connect(2)` on a Unix
//! socket, which is cheap, and a connection per attached PTY for as long as
//! it is attached, which is what the daemon expects anyway.
//!
//! The cost is that the declaration is sent every time. That is a feature: a
//! latch that survived across requests would be state, and state is what has
//! to be got right.
