//! The encrypted channel, and the two handshakes that open one.
//!
//! ## Which library, and what "audited" is worth here
//!
//! [`snow`] is the reference Rust implementation of the Noise Protocol
//! Framework, over RustCrypto's ChaCha20-Poly1305 and BLAKE2s and
//! dalek-cryptography's X25519. Noise itself has been formally analysed
//! several times and is what WireGuard is built on; the primitives underneath
//! have been audited independently. `snow` has no standalone audit of its own,
//! and P1-051's "audited standard cryptographic libraries" should be read as
//! *standard, widely deployed and not written here* rather than as a
//! certificate. Writing the handshake by hand out of the same primitives would
//! be strictly worse and is the alternative this rejects.
//!
//! ## Two patterns, for two different situations
//!
//! **`Noise_NK` for pairing.** The device has just scanned a QR code, so it
//! knows the desktop's static public key and the desktop knows nothing about
//! the device. NK is exactly that: responder static known to the initiator,
//! initiator anonymous. The device sends its own static key and the one-time
//! pairing token *inside* the encrypted handshake payload, so neither is on
//! the wire in the clear and neither is replayable against a different
//! desktop — the QR key is mixed into the handshake hash.
//!
//! **`Noise_IK` afterwards.** Both statics are known, and IK transmits the
//! initiator's static encrypted to the responder's. Two consequences that
//! matter: a relay operator carrying the bytes never learns which device is
//! connecting, and the responder identifies the device by decrypting rather
//! than by being told — so there is no plaintext device id for anyone to
//! correlate across connections. This is WireGuard's pattern for the same
//! reasons.
//!
//! `XX` is not used anywhere. It would let a device connect without knowing
//! the desktop's key in advance, and "the device does not need to know who it
//! is talking to" is the property that makes a man in the middle possible.
//! The QR code is the out-of-band authenticated channel, and refusing to work
//! without it is the design.
//!
//! ## The prologue
//!
//! Both handshakes mix a prologue: the protocol version and, for pairing, the
//! desktop's own public key. Noise binds the prologue into the handshake
//! hash, so two ends that disagree about either simply fail to complete —
//! rather than completing and then discovering they cannot parse each other,
//! which is how a downgrade gets negotiated.
