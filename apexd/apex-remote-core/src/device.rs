//! Paired devices: what is stored about one, and what revoking it means.
//!
//! ## What is stored, and what is not
//!
//! A device record holds a **public** key and nothing else that is secret.
//! This machine's own static secret key lives in a separate file
//! ([`crate::identity`]) that no listing, no reply and no log line ever
//! touches; a device's *private* key never leaves the device, which is the
//! point of pairing a key rather than sharing a passphrase.
//!
//! So a stolen `devices.json` tells an attacker which phones the owner has
//! paired and when they last connected. It does not let them connect.
//!
//! ## Why revocation is a tombstone and not a deletion
//!
//! `revoked_ms` is set; the record stays. Deleting it would leave the store
//! unable to tell "a device that was never paired" from "a device the owner
//! threw off this machine on Tuesday", and those want different answers: the
//! first may pair again with a fresh token the owner approves, and the second
//! must be refused even if it somehow obtains one. P1-051 asks for a
//! paired-device list showing revocation state, which is the same requirement
//! from the other side — a list that forgets cannot show it.
//!
//! A tombstone also survives the race that matters. A phone with a live
//! connection when the owner revokes it is holding a channel this store
//! cannot reach into; the connection is dropped by `apex-remoted`, and the
//! tombstone is what stops the immediate reconnect.
