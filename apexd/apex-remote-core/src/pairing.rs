//! Pairing: the QR code, the token behind it, and what makes it safe.
//!
//! ## The QR code is the security boundary
//!
//! Everything else in this crate is a key exchange between two parties that
//! already know each other. Pairing is the one moment they do not, and the
//! thing that bridges it is a human looking at a screen. That is not a
//! weakness of the design; it is the design. A QR code shown on the desktop
//! and read by the phone is an **out-of-band authenticated channel**: an
//! attacker on the network cannot write to it, and one who can read it is
//! already standing in the room.
//!
//! So the QR carries the desktop's static public key, and the device pins it.
//! No certificate authority, no trust-on-first-use, no "verify these emoji"
//! step that people click through. A man in the middle presenting its own key
//! makes the handshake fail rather than succeed with a warning.
//!
//! ## Why there is also a one-time token
//!
//! The public key alone authenticates the *desktop* to the *device*. The
//! token authenticates in the other direction: it says the device holding it
//! is the one the owner just showed the code to, and not a second device that
//! learned the desktop's key some other way — from a previous QR, from a
//! screenshot, from a neighbour's phone photographing the screen an hour
//! earlier.
//!
//! It is therefore: random, single-use, short-lived, compared in constant
//! time, and **never on the wire in the clear** — it travels inside the
//! encrypted `Noise_NK` handshake payload, which is bound to the desktop key
//! it was shown with. A token captured from a QR photo is worth nothing after
//! [`PairingOffer::ttl_ms`], and worth nothing at all once one device has
//! used it.
//!
//! ## "Pairing cannot be completed silently by an agent"
//!
//! P1-051's fourth criterion. Two independent mechanisms, because one is a
//! policy and the other is a fact:
//!
//! * An offer only exists while a human asked for one. There is no verb that
//!   creates a pairing token as a side effect of anything else, and an offer
//!   expires on its own.
//! * `apex-remoted` refuses to *make* an offer for a caller whose request
//!   origin is not local — the same `origin::observe` rule the agent runtime
//!   uses to decide who may approve root. An agent inside a session is under
//!   `user@N.service`, classifies as `scheduled-job`, and is refused. See
//!   `apex-remoted`'s control socket.
