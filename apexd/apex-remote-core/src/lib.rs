//! APEX Remote — the protocol a paired device speaks to this machine.
//!
//! Roadmap §46, tasks P1-050/051/052. `apex-remoted` is the desktop service
//! that speaks it; `apex remote` is the CLI that pairs and revokes; the
//! Android app is the first client and deliberately not the only one it can
//! have.
//!
//! ## The one idea
//!
//! **A remote client is a viewport.** P1-030 settled the same argument about
//! terminal multiplexers — a durable thing must not live inside an ephemeral
//! one — and the same answer applies here: `apex-agentd` owns the PTYs, the
//! sessions, the projects and the policy, and it goes on owning them whether
//! or not a phone is connected. This crate is transport, authentication and
//! framing. It is not a second agent runtime, and nothing it does is visible
//! to a session.
//!
//! Concretely: [`wire::Frame::Control`] carries one line of `apex-agentd`'s
//! own NDJSON protocol, unaltered. Provider neutrality is then not something
//! this crate has to achieve — the daemon already speaks to Claude, OpenCode,
//! Codex, Gemini and a generic managed PTY through one adapter layer, and a
//! remote client reaches all of them by reaching the daemon.
//!
//! ## The four things it does add
//!
//! * [`identity`] — this machine's long-term static keypair.
//! * [`device`] — which devices are paired, and which are revoked.
//! * [`pairing`] — the QR code, the one-time token behind it, and the
//!   handshake that turns them into a paired key.
//! * [`session`] — a Noise channel, and the frames inside it.
//!
//! and one it deliberately does not: it never sees a credential. `SecretValue`
//! in `apex-secret-core` implements neither `Serialize` nor `Deserialize`, and
//! the daemon's `Response` derives `Serialize`, so a reply carrying a
//! credential does not compile. That property is inherited here for free,
//! because what this forwards is that same `Response`.
