//! Waking a phone that is **not** connected (P1-058).
//!
//! Everything else in this crate assumes a live channel: a device dialled the
//! LAN listener or met this machine at the relay, and both ends are holding a
//! socket open. Notifications built on that arrive only while the app is
//! running and its poll loop is alive, which is the honest limit the Android
//! client has been carrying in its own source since the feature landed.
//!
//! This module is the other half. It is what lets an agent that needs somebody
//! reach a phone whose screen is off, whose app was killed by the platform
//! hours ago, and whose network Android has suspended in Doze.
//!
//! ## Why UnifiedPush, stated as a decision and not as a default
//!
//! Three transports were weighed. The criterion that decided it is P1-058's
//! second — *"notification content is encrypted/minimised so push
//! infrastructure does not receive sensitive prompt/code content"* — together
//! with the one physical fact that constrains all of them: **only a process
//! that Android exempts from Doze can wake a sleeping phone.**
//!
//! * **FCM** would work on stock Android and is what most apps use. It is
//!   refused here for two independent reasons, either of which is enough. It
//!   requires a Firebase project — an account, a `google-services.json` in the
//!   repository, and a Google dependency in a distribution that has
//!   deliberately avoided one. And every wakeup would be a request to Google,
//!   which learns *when* an agent on this person's laptop wanted them even if
//!   it learns nothing about *what*.
//! * **The APEX relay** (`relay/`, deployed at `apex-relay.andrenijman.com`)
//!   looks like the answer because APEX already owns it, and it is the wrong
//!   layer. It is a rendezvous: a Durable Object that copies bytes between two
//!   WebSockets **that have both dialled in**. Push is exactly the case where
//!   the phone has not. Teaching it to queue would not help, because no
//!   Cloudflare Worker can wake a Doze'd phone either — the wakeup has to come
//!   from a process already running on the device.
//! * **UnifiedPush** is what remains, and it is the right answer rather than
//!   the leftover one. The user's chosen *distributor* — ntfy, NextPush,
//!   Conversations — is the app holding the persistent connection, and it is
//!   exempt from battery optimisation because the user installed it for that
//!   purpose. APEX Remote never holds a socket open, never runs a foreground
//!   service, and needs no Google. The distributor is replaceable, the push
//!   server may be the user's own, and neither is trusted by a single line of
//!   this module.
//!
//! **What Andre has to do for this to work is named in `docs/remote.md` and is
//! not nothing:** a UnifiedPush distributor has to be installed on the phone.
//! Nothing has to be stood up on the desktop, nothing is deployed anywhere,
//! and `ntfy.sh` needs no account.
//!
//! ## What crosses the push infrastructure
//!
//! An [`Envelope`]: **51 bytes**, of which 38 are ciphertext. There is no
//! field in it that can hold a sentence. The plaintext is
//! [`Body`] — a kind, an adapter *code*, a session number, the session's start
//! time and a sequence number — five fixed-width integers, and the type has no
//! `String` in it at all. That is deliberate and it is the whole answer to
//! criterion 2: a payload that cannot express prompt text cannot leak it,
//! whatever a future caller does.
//!
//! What the push server and the distributor *do* learn is stated rather than
//! glossed: that a registration received something, when, and that it was 51
//! bytes. The size is constant across every kind, so the length discloses
//! nothing about which one it was. They do not learn the machine, the project,
//! the adapter, or what the agent was doing.
//!
//! There is no cleartext machine identifier in the envelope because none is
//! needed: the phone registers **one UnifiedPush instance per paired machine**
//! and the instance token, which is the phone's own and never leaves it,
//! is what says which machine a message came from. A successful decryption
//! then proves it: the key is per-registration, so only the machine the phone
//! handed it to can produce a body that opens.
//!
//! ## Why the key is handed over and not derived
//!
//! The obvious design is a static-static Diffie-Hellman between this machine's
//! identity key and the device's — no new secret, nothing to store. It does
//! not work, and the reason is on the phone rather than here.
//!
//! The Android device key lives wrapped by a keystore key created with
//! `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`, per-use. `StaticKey.agree` can raise
//! a biometric prompt and can throw. A `BroadcastReceiver` woken at three in
//! the morning by a distributor cannot satisfy that, so every push would fail
//! to decrypt on exactly the phones whose owner asked for more protection, and
//! fail silently.
//!
//! So the phone generates 32 random bytes per registration and sends them
//! **inside the Noise channel**, which is already authenticated and already
//! end-to-end. What the key protects is bounded by what an envelope can say,
//! and rotating it costs one re-registration. It is stored here in a file of
//! its own, 0600, and never in `devices.json` — `device.rs` asserts that store
//! holds no secret, and this is a secret.
