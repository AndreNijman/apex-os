//! The only place any of this has been run.
//!
//! There is no Cloudflare account and no Cloudflare token on this machine, so
//! the alternative to a loopback double was a provider nobody had ever seen
//! execute. The double speaks Cloudflare's envelope — `{"success":…,"result":…,
//! "errors":[…]}` — answers the documented paths, and **refuses anything with
//! no `Authorization` header**, which is what makes a passing test mean
//! something: a provider that quietly did nothing would come back 401, not 200.
//!
//! What that proves and what it does not:
//!
//! * proved — the request the provider builds is the shape it means to build,
//!   the credential reaches the far side, none of it reaches the caller, the
//!   binding decides what a name means, and the framework's checks all fire;
//! * not proved — that `api.cloudflare.com` accepts any of these bodies. Every
//!   path is the documented one and not one of them has been called for real.
//!   That is what P1-004's `partial` is for.

// request. They live here rather than in `apex-backup-core` because this is
// where a real credential, a real store, a real grant check and a real project
// binding exist — `apex-backup-core` has the target's logic and a broker
// double, and neither of those can prove that the token is spent and does not
// come back.
//
// They are Rust and not a shell suite for a measured reason: `Api::loopback` is
// `#[cfg(test)]`, so a SHIPPED apex-secretd always addresses
// api.cloudflare.com — and even if it did not, `service.rs`'s host pin refuses
// a credential stored for one host being sent to another. There is no way to
// aim the shipped daemon at a double, which is why every Cloudflare unit in
// this repository is proven here and none of them has a shell test.

//
// * one id shape for all four tables, so a KV id passes as a D1 one, and the
//   reserved-table guard removed so an environment may shadow `[cloudflare.kv]`
//   — `a_d1_id_and_a_kv_id_are_different_shapes_…`,
//   `an_environment_may_not_be_named_after_a_resource_table`;
// * `is_empty` forgetting the new tables — `a_project_that_binds_only_a_…`;
// * `NoResource` falling out of the `NoSuchResource` arm, which is the same
//   defect `NoRecord` had one unit earlier and which this test found again —
//   `a_database_namespace_queue_or_config_…`;
// * a migration accepting any file, and a queue setting skipping its
//   documented range — `a_migration_is_a_file_of_statements_…`,
//   `a_queue_change_is_checked_against_the_ranges_…`;
// * `caching = off` no longer inverted into Cloudflare's `disabled` —
//   `a_hyperdrive_edit_cannot_carry_a_database_credential`;
// * the origin scrub not descending into nested objects, which is where the
//   password actually is — `an_origin_credential_the_api_volunteers_…`;
// * a KV write given both a value and a file quietly picking one —
//   `a_kv_write_takes_a_value_or_a_file_and_never_both`.

// ── §13.11, Workers AI and the AI Gateway ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Nine mutations were run against the arms below, one at a time, each restored
// by copying the pristine file back — and then touching it, which the earlier
// rounds of this program did not have to do and this one did. `cp -p` restores
// the ORIGINAL mtime, which is older than the artifact cargo just built from
// the mutant, so cargo skips the rebuild and the next run measures the MUTANT'S
// BINARY against pristine source. That was caught here by a restored tree
// failing a test it had just passed; every verdict below was re-taken after the
// restore started bumping the mtime.
//
// Every one turns a named test red:
//
// * the header guard in `api::call` stops consulting `printable` —
//   `a_header_carrying_a_second_line_is_refused_before_curl_is_configured`;
// * `cf-aig-gateway-id` is not sent — `a_gatewayed_run_is_the_same_host_…`;
// * `binding.resource("models", …)` replaced by the caller's own string, which
//   is the defect §13.11 exists to prevent — `a_model_or_a_gateway_this_…`;
// * the project's whole PATH sent as the metadata's project —
//   `a_gatewayed_run_is_tagged_with_this_task_…`;
// * `carries_authorization` never fires — `a_gateway_carrying_an_exporter_…`;
// * the `stream` check dropped — `a_streamed_response_is_refused_…`;
// * `GATEWAY_FIELDS` put back nothing — `a_gateway_edit_puts_back_everything_…`;
// * `workers-ai.run` declared `Effect::Read` — `the_declaration_is_well_formed_…`;
// * `valid_model` stops checking segments — `a_model_name_is_checked_as_…`.
//
// **Three of those nine did not bite the first time**, and the tests were the
// thing that changed, not the code:
//
// * the project-path leak passed, because the filter that makes a name
//   header-safe strips `/` as a side effect, so a leaked path arrives with no
//   slash in it and neither "contains no slash" nor "is not the path" notices;
// * the read-modify-write passed with the read discarded entirely, because the
//   assertion asked about `collect_logs` — which the required-field fallback
//   sets to `true` regardless, so preserved and defaulted looked the same;
// * `Effect::Read` on a paid operation passed, because nothing asserted it.
//
// All three are the shape this unit was warned about: a check that is real in
// the code and invisible to the test, which is indistinguishable from no check
// at all the day somebody edits the code.

//
// Seven mutations were run against the arms below, one at a time, each restored
// by copying the pristine file back so that cargo rebuilt rather than reusing
// the mutant's binary. Every one turns a named test red:
//
// * the lookup trusting `search` instead of checking the exact name, which is
//   the ordinary mistake here because `search` is a SUBSTRING match and a store
//   holding `API_KEY` and `API_KEY_OLD` answers for both —
//   `rotating_a_secret_matches_the_exact_name_and_not_a_prefix_of_it`;
// * a refused credential reported as a missing secret —
//   `a_secret_that_is_not_there_is_told_apart_from_a_credential_…`;
// * "you named no secret" reported as "you may not" —
//   `a_store_this_project_did_not_bind_…`. That one is the THIRD instance of
//   this defect in the Cloudflare block, and the two it joins (R2's
//   bucket-with-no-key and KV's namespace-with-no-key) were found while writing
//   it and fixed in the same commit;
// * a value given twice silently picked, and scopes forwarded unchecked —
//   `a_value_given_twice_or_not_at_all_…`, `a_scope_cloudflare_does_not_…`;
// * the binding replacing the worker's bindings instead of merging into them,
//   which would take every other binding off the worker —
//   `a_binding_is_a_reference_and_the_worker_s_other_bindings_survive_it`;
// * the shell's trailing newline sent as part of the secret —
//   `a_secret_value_travels_as_input_and_never_as_an_option`.

// ── §13.10, Cloudflare One ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Seven mutations were run against the arms below, one at a time, each restored
// by copying the pristine file back so that cargo rebuilt rather than reusing
// the mutant's binary. Every one turns a named test red:
//
// * the provider no longer stripping `client_secret` from its own reply —
//   `the_provider_takes_the_token_secret_out_before_the_framework_ever_sees_it`.
//   Worth reading the note in that test: with BOTH layers present this mutation
//   changed nothing any test going through `use_capability` could see, because
//   the framework's scrub caught it. The test was rewritten to call `perform`
//   directly, and only then did the mutation bite. Two layers need two tests;
//   the framework's is `service.rs`'s `SEAM-M1`;
// * the created credential pinned to `api.cloudflare.com` — the API that
//   ISSUED it rather than the host it may be sent to — and the host taken from
//   the caller instead of resolved through the project's binding:
//   `an_access_service_token_is_kept_here_…`,
//   `a_host_this_project_did_not_bind_…`;
// * `access.read` no longer scrubbing a SaaS `client_secret`, and the scrub no
//   longer descending into arrays —
//   `an_access_application_that_carries_a_client_secret_…`,
//   `a_credential_nested_in_an_array_is_still_taken_out`. The second of those
//   also needed its own test: every secret the double nests today is inside an
//   OBJECT, so array descent was untested until something asserted it;
// * the duration forwarded to Cloudflare unchecked —
//   `a_service_token_duration_cloudflare_would_refuse_…`;
// * an Access application id validated as 32 hex alone, which refuses the UUID
//   half of Cloudflare's own `oneOf` —
//   `an_access_service_token_is_kept_here_…`.
