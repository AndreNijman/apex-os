//! Cloudflare, as one module and one `register` call.
//!
//! P1-001's evidence made a claim about itself: *"P1-002 adds Cloudflare as one
//! module and one register call, with nothing changing in `apex-agent-core`,
//! `apex-agentd` or the CLI."* This directory is the test of it. Nothing in
//! those three crates knows the word Cloudflare, the wire carries an operation
//! id and an option map that were already there, and `apex secret capabilities`
//! prints these operations because the daemon advertises its registry rather
//! than because anyone added them to a list.
//!
//! ## What this supplies, and what it therefore cannot get wrong
//!
//! The four things [`crate::provider`] asks for:
//!
//! * **which operations exist** — [`SPEC`], §13.2's names for the Workers
//!   surface plus the account read that `apex cf status` is built on;
//! * **what a resource name means** — [`binding`], which is §13.1: `project`
//!   is a worker this project bound to an environment, `example.com` is its
//!   zone, and a name it did not bind does not resolve at all;
//! * **how a credential is presented** — [`api`], a `curl` the broker owns,
//!   with the token on the child's stdin and never in `argv`;
//! * **how to mint a short-lived one** — [`temporary`], which is §13.4: the
//!   stored token buys a token carrying one permission group at one scope,
//!   expiring in minutes, deleted the moment the operation returns. A request
//!   for one has four answers and they are not the same answer —
//!   [`crate::provider::Minted`] separates *there is nothing narrower* from
//!   *the account refused* from *the attempt did not run* — and the trail
//!   records which. Three of the four carry on with the stored credential,
//!   because §13.4 says *prefer*; a project that wrote
//!   `temporary_credentials = "require"` gets a refusal instead.
//!
//! And a fifth thing, which is §13.4's other sentence:
//!
//! * **how to run the tool instead of the API** — [`tools`], a broker-owned
//!   `wrangler` or `terraform` with the credential in its environment and a
//!   fixed argv this build writes.
//!
//! Everything else is the framework's, in the order [`crate::provider`] sets
//! out, and this module could not skip a step if it tried: it never sees the
//! stored value until after the grant and the host pin, and the value it does
//! see is scrubbed out of the result by somebody else.
//!
//! ## The pin is real here in a way it is not for git
//!
//! `git`'s endpoint comes out of the caller's own repository, so pinning it
//! catches a repository that points somewhere else. Cloudflare's endpoint is
//! [`api::API_HOST`], a constant. That makes the pin a flat statement: a
//! credential stored for any other host cannot be spent on a Cloudflare
//! operation, and a Cloudflare token stored for `api.cloudflare.com` cannot be
//! spent anywhere else. Neither half needs this module's cooperation.
//!
//! ## Resolving twice, and why
//!
//! [`crate::provider::Bound`] carries an endpoint and a sentence, and nothing a
//! provider defines. So what `bind` worked out cannot be handed to `perform`,
//! and `perform` has to read the project file again. Between the two reads the
//! owner could change it — the owner is the caller — so `perform` rebuilds the
//! sentence and refuses if it is not the one `bind` was pinned on. That closes
//! it here. It is not closed in general, and the git provider has the same gap:
//! `bind` resolves a remote with `git remote get-url` and `perform` runs
//! `git push <remote>`, which resolves it again inside the child.
//!
//! ## What R2 can and cannot carry
//!
//! §13.5 asks for bucket- and object-scoped capabilities, and that is what the
//! three R2 operations are: the bucket is one the project's own file lists, and
//! an object is a key under it. Three limits are in the build rather than in a
//! plan, and each is a consequence of something else here being right:
//!
//! * **an object comes back as text.** [`crate::broker::run_curl`] hands back a
//!   `String`, and every reply in this service travels to the caller as one. A
//!   read of a PNG therefore arrives lossily converted. Text objects — a SQL
//!   dump, a JSON manifest, a log — are exact, and those are what an agent has
//!   any business reading through a broker;
//! * **an object key is a [`apex_secret_core::operation::Syntax::Path`]**, so
//!   `backups/2026-09-12.sql` can be named and `backups/2026-09-12T10:00.sql`
//!   cannot: `:` is refused by the grammar because a resource that could carry
//!   one could be read as a URL. The grammar is load-bearing and the key
//!   restriction is the price;
//! * **ten megabytes**, [`MAX_PAYLOAD`], against the documented endpoint's 300.
//!   A backup larger than that is not an agent operation.
//!
//! §13.5 also calls R2 "the preferred first-party cloud target for encrypted
//! APEX backups". That is P1-010's, and the object write below is the half of
//! it that does not need a backup format to exist first.
//!
//! ## The four storage surfaces, and the one thing they share
//!
//! D1, KV, Queues and Hyperdrive are §13.3's, and every one of them is
//! addressed by an **id** — there is no name-based path for any of the four,
//! the way there is for an R2 bucket. So §13.1's file carries the name the
//! project uses and the id the API needs, one table per product, and a name it
//! does not list does not resolve. A build that took the id from the caller
//! would have no binding at all: "which database" would be the agent's answer
//! rather than the owner's.
//!
//! Three consequences worth stating where they will be read:
//!
//! * **a D1 database id is a UUID and the other three are 32 hex.** That is
//!   Cloudflare's split, not a convenience, and one validator for both would
//!   either refuse every real D1 id or admit 36 characters of anything into a
//!   URL path;
//! * **a KV read answers with the value's bytes**, like an R2 object read, so
//!   the same lossy-text limitation applies to a value that is not UTF-8;
//! * **a Hyperdrive configuration carries the password of the database it
//!   fronts.** `edit` declares a name and three caching settings and nothing
//!   else, so the framework refuses an origin field before this module is
//!   asked; and `read` has its reply stripped of `password` and
//!   `access_client_secret` even though the documentation says they are
//!   write-only and never returned. A guarantee that an agent gets
//!   capabilities and not credentials cannot rest on a remark in somebody
//!   else's documentation staying true.
//!
//! ## §13.11, and a finding that decided its shape
//!
//! An AI Gateway run looked like it would need a second host. The
//! provider-specific endpoint is `gateway.ai.cloudflare.com`, the framework
//! pins a credential to the host it was stored for, and that would have meant
//! the owner storing the same token twice under two service names.
//!
//! It does not. AI Gateway's REST API page documents the **gatewayed form of
//! the ordinary call** — `POST /accounts/{id}/ai/run/{model}` with a
//! `cf-aig-gateway-id` header, on `api.cloudflare.com` like everything else
//! here — so `workers-ai.run` and `ai-gateway.run` are the same URL and the
//! same credential, and what separates them is a header and a grant. The pin
//! never has to be argued with.
//!
//! **Where that comes from, and where it does not.** Every other claim in this
//! provider is checked against the pinned schema. This one cannot be: the
//! schema's `workers-ai-post-run-model` declares two path parameters and **no
//! headers at all**, and the string `cf-aig` does not occur anywhere in its
//! 25MB. So the schema neither documents this nor contradicts it, and the
//! source is the documentation:
//!
//! * <https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/rest-api/> shows the
//!   gatewayed call with the model in the URL path and the `cf-aig-gateway-id`
//!   header, and says in as many words that "the existing Workers AI endpoint
//!   with the model ID in the URL path also continues to work";
//! * <https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/> shows
//!   the ungatewayed one — the same path, `Authorization` only, a `prompt`
//!   body — which is what `workers-ai.run` sends;
//! * <https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/configuration/custom-metadata/>
//!   is where `cf-aig-metadata`'s limits come from: at most five entries,
//!   values of string, number or boolean, and keys beginning `cf.` reserved to
//!   Cloudflare. [`usage_metadata`] sends three strings and a test asserts all
//!   three limits.
//!
//! One line on that first page reads "Workers AI requests always require this
//! header", which looks like it contradicts the second page. It does not: that
//! sentence is about AI Gateway's own front door, `POST /ai/run` with the model
//! in the **body**. This build uses the path form for both operations, which
//! that same page says keeps working. If it ever stops,
//! `a_gatewayed_run_is_the_same_host_and_the_same_credential_as_an_ungatewayed_one`
//! is the test that describes what was assumed.
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating where they will be read:
//!
//! * **the gateway id comes from §13.1's file and never from the caller.**
//!   Cloudflare creates a gateway on the first authenticated request that names
//!   one that does not exist, so a caller that could name a gateway could
//!   create one — and bill it;
//! * **the model is bound too.** `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` is not an
//!   [`apex_secret_core::operation::Syntax::Name`] — the grammar wants an
//!   alphanumeric first character — so a model could not be named as a resource
//!   even if this build wanted the agent to choose one. §13.14's cost
//!   guardrails start here, with the owner deciding which models a project may
//!   run.
//!
//! §13.11's remainder is **not** here and cannot be: *"APEX local AI service
//! may route to… Workers AI, AI Gateway"*. `apex-aid` is that service, and two
//! things about it, both checked rather than assumed:
//!
//! * `apexd_core::ai::Backend` is a *compute* backend — `Cuda`, `Rocm`,
//!   `Vulkan`, `Cpu` — with no notion of a remote provider to select. Named
//!   here in plain backticks and not as an intra-doc link on purpose:
//!   `apexd-core` is not a dependency of this crate, which is itself part of
//!   the point, and a link to it would be a rustdoc warning rather than a link;
//! * the inference runtime is started under `bubblewrap` with `--unshare-net`,
//!   and `apex-aid`'s own module note calls that flag the load-bearing one.
//!   The backend cannot reach `api.cloudflare.com` because it cannot reach
//!   anything.
//!
//! So routing the local service through Cloudflare is not a missing URL, it is
//! a design change in another crate: something outside the sandbox would have
//! to make the brokered call and hand the answer in. What this provider
//! supplies is that brokered route, which is the half that belongs here.
//!
//! ## §13.10, and the one thing this surface does that no other does
//!
//! Access and Tunnels are §13.10's, and they are the first operations here that
//! can **create a credential**. `POST /access/service_tokens` answers with a
//! `client_secret`; Cloudflare shows it once. §13.10 says where it goes —
//! *"directly into protected storage… the agent receives handles/capabilities,
//! not plaintext secrets"* — and [`crate::provider::Bound::creates`] is how it
//! gets there: this module names the service before the call so the framework
//! can refuse a collision while refusing is free, hands back the value after,
//! and returns the `client_id` and the handle to the caller.
//!
//! The pin is the part worth reading twice. A service token is presented to the
//! application Access guards, never to the API that issued it, so the stored
//! credential is pinned to a **host in this project's own zone** — resolved
//! through [`binding::Binding::record`], with §13.9's label boundary and its
//! `records` narrowing. A project that narrowed itself to some names cannot pin
//! a credential to a different one, and a credential pinned to
//! `api.cloudflare.com` would be a pin that says the wrong thing.
//!
//! ## What has never run against Cloudflare
//!
//! All of it. There is no account and no token on this machine, so every
//! operation below has been exercised against a loopback server that speaks the
//! same envelope and refuses without an `Authorization` header, and none of it
//! against `api.cloudflare.com`. The paths are the documented ones — read out
//! of `cloudflare/api-schemas`' `openapi.json` at `d5003a19`, and cross-checked
//! against the rendered reference — and that they are the documented ones is
//! not the same as having called them.

        //   addressed by an id that does not exist until it does — so unlike an
        //   R2 bucket, which §13.1's file can name into existence, a tunnel
        //   cannot resolve through the project's own binding until after it has
        //   been made. The owner creates it and writes the id down;
        // * **reading a tunnel's token.** It is a credential, and a credential
        //   this build cannot pin honestly: `cloudflared` presents it to the
        //   Cloudflare edge over QUIC, not to any HTTPS host the store could
        //   name. Storing it would mean writing a `host` the pin cannot mean.
        //   §12's `cloudflared auth -> APEX` is where a broker-owned connector
        //   would spend it, and that is where it belongs;
