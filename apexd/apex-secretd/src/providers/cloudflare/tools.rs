//! P1-012: `wrangler` and `terraform`, run by the broker, credentialled by it.
//!
//! > *"Existing skills can continue invoking normal tools."*
//! > *"Tool wrappers/helpers request capabilities transparently."*
//!
//! ## What is transparent about it
//!
//! A skill that has always run `wrangler deploy` goes on running
//! `wrangler deploy`. What changes is which `wrangler` is first on its `PATH`:
//! `files/system/libexec/apex-tool-broker`, symlinked as `wrangler` and
//! `terraform`, which recognises the subcommands below and asks
//! `apex-secretd` to run the real one. The tool believes it has credentials
//! because it does — in its own environment, put there by a process the agent
//! cannot read. The agent never had them.
//!
//! Anything the shim does not recognise execs the real tool unchanged, so
//! `wrangler --version` and `wrangler types` keep working. They will not be
//! authenticated, which is the truth: the agent has no credential.
//!
//! ## Why the vocabulary is subcommands and not "run wrangler"
//!
//! An operation called `cloudflare.wrangler.run` taking the caller's own argv
//! would be a grant to do anything `wrangler` can do, which is everything this
//! provider spent P1-004 through P1-010 carefully not granting in one piece.
//! It would also be ungovernable: `wrangler delete` and `wrangler deploy` are
//! one word apart. So each brokered subcommand is its own operation with its
//! own grant and a **fixed argv this file writes**. Nothing the caller sends
//! reaches the command line except through [`Brokered::environment`], which is
//! an environment name the project's own `apex.toml` had to bind first.
//!
//! ## Why the list is short, and why `cloudflared` is not on it
//!
//! [`crate::provider::Performed`] carries an exit code and a `String`. A tool
//! that streams or blocks does not fit it and would hang a connection thread
//! until the timeout: `wrangler tail`, `terraform apply` without
//! `-auto-approve`, and every useful `cloudflared` subcommand are all one of
//! those. `cloudflared tunnel run` *is* the streaming case — it is a daemon —
//! and `mod.rs` already declines to broker a connector token for a reason that
//! has not changed: the token is presented to the Cloudflare edge over QUIC,
//! not to any HTTPS host the store can pin it to. §12's `cloudflared auth ->
//! APEX` is where that belongs, and it is not this.
//!
//! So: four subcommands, each of which starts, finishes and prints.
//!
//! ## What §13.1's binding gates here, and what it does not
//!
//! Worth stating plainly, because it is weaker than it looks. For the REST
//! operations the project's `apex.toml` decides the **script name in the URL**,
//! so a worker the project did not bind cannot be addressed at all. For a
//! brokered `wrangler`, the binding decides the grant, the account id and
//! `--env` — but the script that gets deployed is whatever `wrangler.toml` in
//! the caller's own directory names. `wrangler` reads that file and this build
//! does not.
//!
//! That is the same trust model rather than a hole: `apex.toml` and
//! `wrangler.toml` are both the caller's own files, in the caller's own
//! project, and a caller who can edit one can edit the other. But it means
//! `a_worker_this_project_did_not_bind_never_reaches_wrangler` proves the
//! *name* was refused before anything ran, not that wrangler could only have
//! deployed the bound script.
