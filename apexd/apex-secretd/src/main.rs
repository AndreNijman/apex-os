//! `apex-secretd` — the APEX protected secret service (roadmap §11, P0-002).
//!
//! A separate daemon from `apex-agentd` and from `apexd`, for one reason:
//! `apex-agentd` runs as the user because it launches the user's own programs,
//! so anything it can read a managed agent with that uid can read too. A
//! credential store it owns is a credential store the agent owns.
//!
//! ```text
//! agent / apex secret use
//!      │  capability request                    (a NAME, never a URL)
//!      ▼
//! apex-agentd            — as the user; resolves the session and its policy
//!      │  newline-delimited JSON on /run/apex-secretd/control.sock
//!      ▼
//! apex-secretd           — as root; store at /var/lib/apex-secretd, 0700
//!      ├─ SO_PEERCRED + a pinned /proc dirfd            peer.rs
//!      ├─ the verbs, and who may ask for them           service.rs
//!      └─ git, run as the owner with the credential     broker.rs
//!               │
//!               ▼  the operation's output, credential scrubbed out
//! ```
//!
//! Root, and deliberately. The store has to be unreadable by the user's uid or
//! P0-002's first criterion is not met, and the operation has to run *as* the
//! user or git would execute a caller-controlled repository's configuration as
//! root. Only a process that starts privileged can do both. The unit that ships
//! it takes away everything else — see `files/system/units/apex-secretd.service`.
//!
//! Nothing here is agent orchestration, and nothing here talks to `apexd`.
//! AGENTS.md's rule that `apex-agentd` must stay unprivileged is untouched: it
//! stays unprivileged and becomes a *client* of this daemon, which is what let
//! it stop holding credentials at all.

const USAGE: &str = "\
apex-secretd — the APEX protected secret service

usage:
  apex-secretd [--socket PATH] [--store DIR]

options:
  --socket PATH   listen here instead of /run/apex-secretd/control.sock
  --store DIR     keep credentials here instead of /var/lib/apex-secretd
  -h, --help      print this
  -V, --version   print the version

Credentials are stored outside every path a managed agent can read, and no
reply this service sends contains one. An agent asks for an operation; the
service performs it and returns the result.

Run as root in the image. Started by hand it works, keeps its store wherever
you pointed it, and says `protected: false` — because a store the user can
read is not a boundary.
