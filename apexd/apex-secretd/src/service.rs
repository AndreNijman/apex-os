//! The verbs, and who may ask for them.
//!
//! One method per request. Every one of them starts from the *peer's* uid,
//! never from anything the request carried, because the request is written by
//! whoever connected.
//!
//! ## The two authorisation questions
//!
//! **Whose credentials are these?** The uid from `SO_PEERCRED`. The store is
//! per-uid, so a request only ever reaches the connecting account's own
//! namespace and there is no verb that names another.
//!
//! **May this caller change what is allowed?** Only if it is not inside a
//! managed agent session — see `peer::looks_like_a_session`. A session that can
//! grant itself a capability has no capabilities, so `add`, `remove`, `grant`
//! and `revoke` are refused for one. `use` is not: performing a granted
//! operation is the entire point.
//!
//! That second check is a *hardening* measure, not the confidentiality
//! boundary. It rests on `/proc` and cgroup membership, both of which a
//! determined same-uid process can eventually work around. What it cannot work
//! around is the store being root-owned and the protocol having no verb that
//! returns a value.
