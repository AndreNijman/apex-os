//! A directory on another machine, reached with `ssh`. P2-001's fourth kind.
//!
//! This was the one of §13.5's five that this build refused, and the reason
//! recorded against it was not "nobody wrote it" but a test problem:
//!
//! > a transport proven only against a fake `ssh` on PATH is a test of the
//! > argument list and not of a backup.
//!
//! So there are two halves here and both are needed. The argument list is built
//! by [`SshTarget::argv`] and pinned by unit tests, because that is where the
//! security properties are; and `tests/test-apex-backup-ssh.sh` runs the whole
//! thing against a **real `sshd` on loopback**, with a fixture host key and a
//! fixture client key, so that the framing, the exit codes and the binary
//! round trip are proved against the program that will actually be on the other
//! end.
//!
//! # The argument list is the security property
//!
//! An ssh backup target that fell back to the owner's ssh agent, or accepted
//! whatever host key it was offered, would be worse than no ssh target: the
//! first hands a long-lived credential to a backup run, and the second backs up
//! to whoever answers on that address. Every invocation therefore carries, with
//! no way for configuration to remove them:
//!
//! | option | why |
//! |---|---|
//! | `-F /dev/null` | `~/.ssh/config` cannot redirect this, add a `ProxyCommand`, or change the user |
//! | `-o IdentityAgent=none` | the owner's agent is never reachable, even if `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` somehow survived |
//! | `-o IdentitiesOnly=yes` | only the key this target names is offered |
//! | `-o BatchMode=yes` | never a prompt — a backup that blocks on a passphrase is a backup that did not happen |
//! | `-o NumberOfPasswordPrompts=0` | the same, for the password path specifically |
//! | `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` | a host key that is not the pinned one is a refusal, not a question |
//! | `-o UserKnownHostsFile=…` | the pin is this target's file and not the owner's |
//! | `-o GlobalKnownHostsFile=/dev/null` | nor `/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts` |
//! | `-o PreferredAuthentications=publickey` | no keyboard-interactive, no GSSAPI |
//! | `-n` is **not** used | stdin is how a chunk's bytes get there |
//!
//! and the child is spawned with [`std::process::Command::env_clear`], so
//! `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `SSH_ASKPASS` and `DISPLAY` are not inherited. That is
//! belt and braces with `IdentityAgent=none` and `BatchMode=yes` on purpose:
//! each of the three would have to be defeated separately.
//!
//! # Why the remote side is a small shell script and not `cat`
//!
//! [`Target::get`] has to distinguish three answers, and `cat missing-file`
//! gives the same exit status as `cat unreadable-file`. So each remote command
//! is a short `sh` script that tests the path first and exits with a code from
//! [`code`] — 10 for "not there", 11 for "there and not readable", 12 for "the
//! target root is not a directory". `ssh` reserves **255** for its own
//! failures, and the script never produces it, so a connection that did not
//! happen is unambiguous.
//!
//! That distinction is the entire reason this module is 300 lines rather than
//! 80. A backup target that reported "no such snapshot" when what happened was
//! "the far side would not let me look" is precisely the defect
//! [`crate::Verdict`] exists to refuse.
//!
//! # Bytes, not base64
//!
//! Unlike [`super::r2`], nothing here passes through
//! `String::from_utf8_lossy`: `ssh` gives a clean binary stream in both
//! directions and [`Transport::run`] hands back `Vec<u8>`. A chunk of
//! ciphertext goes up and comes back byte for byte, which
//! `a_chunk_that_is_not_utf8_survives_the_round_trip` asserts with a body that
//! is invalid UTF-8 in four different ways.
