//!   `tmpfs`, so no session state ever reaches disk;
//! * session records and logs live in `$XDG_STATE_HOME` — they survive a
//!   daemon restart and a reboot so `apex agent list` can still explain what
//!   ran yesterday;
//! * per-session scratch lives under `/tmp/apex-agent-<uid>/<id>` — it is the
//!   one writable path outside the project that a sandboxed agent gets, and it
//!   is removed with the session. The uid is in the path because it was not,
//!   once, and a second account on the machine then could not start a session
//!   at all: see [`SCRATCH_ROOT_PREFIX`].
//!
//! Nothing here is privileged. Every path is user-owned and every directory is
//! created `0700`, because a session log is a transcript of the user's work.

///
/// ```text
/// $ ls -lad /tmp/apex-agent
/// drwxr-xr-x  andre  /tmp/apex-agent
/// ```
///
/// `0755`, owned by whoever logged in first, and that is not an accident of
/// this machine: [`ensure_private_dir`] is called on the LEAF
/// (`<root>/<id>`), so `create_dir_all` makes the root along the way under the
/// caller's umask and only the leaf is chmodded to `0700`. `/tmp` is sticky,
/// so the second user can neither write into that directory nor remove it.
///
/// Two things follow, and both are P2-016 criterion 1 — per-user agents and
/// session isolation:
///
///  * **the second account cannot run an agent at all.** `session.rs` treats a
///    failure to create the scratch directory as fatal, deliberately, so every
///    session start for the second user ends in `EACCES` on a directory owned
///    by the first. Whoever logs in first owns the feature for the machine.
///  * **session ids collide across accounts.** Ids are allocated per daemon
///    and start again at 1, so two users' session 1 name one directory — and a
///    session reap runs `remove_dir_all` on its own id's directory, which is
///    the hazard [`SCRATCH_ROOT_ENV`] was added to keep a *test* daemon away
///    from a live one. Two accounts are the same collision with no variable to
///    set.
///
/// So the default carries the uid. Each account creates its own top-level
/// directory in `/tmp`, which is world-writable, and never needs write
/// permission on anything another account made.
///
/// ## The pre-created root, which this paragraph used to get wrong
///
/// A predictable name in a sticky directory can be pre-created by another
/// account, and the paragraph that stood here said `ensure_private_dir` "will
/// then fail to chmod a directory it does not own", so the worst case was "a
/// loud refusal and a denial of service rather than a disclosure". That was
/// never measured, and it is false. Measured on 2026-09-19 against the real
/// function, with a second account standing in for the attacker:
///
/// ```text
/// nobody pre-creates the root 0755   -> Err(EACCES)        (the claim)
/// nobody pre-creates the root 0777   -> Ok(())             (SILENT SUCCESS)
/// nobody pre-creates the leaf 0777   -> Err(EPERM)
/// nobody plants the leaf as a symlink-> Ok(()), and the SYMLINK TARGET
///                                       was chmodded to 0700
/// ```
///
/// The reason is the one this module already knew about the OLD shared root,
/// repeated one level down: [`ensure_private_dir`] is called on the LEAF, so
/// `create_dir_all` made the root along the way and nothing ever looked at it.
/// `0755` is only the mode an attacker would not choose; at `0777` the session
/// starts with its scratch root owned by another account, which can rename,
/// remove or replace the session's own directory underneath it for as long as
/// the session runs. And row 4 is what row 2 buys: `fs.protected_symlinks`
/// stops a symlink planted directly in sticky `/tmp`, but the attacker-owned
/// root is not sticky, so a symlink planted INSIDE it is followed — giving
/// another account the choice of which of this user's directories gets
/// chmodded `0700` and which one the session's build output lands in.
///
/// Two things close it, and both are needed:
///
///  * [`ensure_private_dir`] refuses a symlink and refuses a directory this
///    account does not own, instead of chmodding whatever it finds; and
///  * **the root is a boundary and is ensured FIRST**, by its own call, before
///    the leaf under it — see `session.rs`. Hardening only the leaf is a check
///    against a moving target: only the owner of a `0700` directory can rename
///    the entries in it, so the leaf's guarantees rest on the root's.
///
/// What is still NOT solved by a path, stated so it is not mistaken for the
