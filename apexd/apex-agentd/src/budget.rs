//! Per-agent resource budgets (roadmap §P2-011).
//!
//! An agent session can be given a cpu, memory, task-count and wall-clock
//! budget by running it inside a transient systemd **user scope**. The whole
//! feature is an argv prefix: `systemd-run --user --scope -q --unit=… -p … --`
//! in front of the argv the session would have run anyway.
//!
//! ## Why a transient scope and not a drop-in
//!
//! `apex-agentd.service` has no `Delegate=`, so it cannot make sub-cgroups of
//! its own. The obvious conclusion — "budgets need a drop-in first" — is
//! wrong, and it was measured: `systemd-run --user --scope` asks the *user
//! manager* to make the cgroup, which needs no delegation, no polkit prompt
//! and no change to the shipped unit. It also **execs in place**: systemd-run
//! creates the scope over the bus and then `execve`s the command in its own
//! process, so the pid the daemon records is still the pid of the real program
//! chain, the process group is unchanged, and everything that counts processes
//! — `peer.rs`'s parent-chain resolution, `apex agent kill`'s killpg — is
//! untouched. That property is what makes the hook one line.
//!
//! ## The polarity, which is the whole design
//!
//! Three of the four controllers are delegated on this class of machine and
//! `io` is not — it is in the root cgroup's `cgroup.controllers` but never in
//! its `subtree_control`, so no `io.max` file exists anywhere under
//! `user.slice`. The rule this module is built around, and the one the rest of
//! this unit kept re-learning the hard way:
//!
//! * a controller that **was read** and is **absent** is a fact. Report it,
//!   carrying the reason, and leave it out of the argv. **Never write a budget
//!   of zero** — an unenforceable limit expressed as `0` is not a conservative
//!   default, it is a kill switch wearing one.
//! * a controllers file that **could not be read** is an unknown, not an
//!   absence. The caller asked for a budget and the daemon cannot tell whether
//!   it would be honoured, so the session is refused rather than started
//!   unbudgeted. A budget that silently is not there is the failure this whole
//!   unit exists to stop shipping.
//!
//! And the file to read is the delegation boundary's **`cgroup.controllers`**,
//! never its `cgroup.subtree_control`: systemd enables a controller in
//! `subtree_control` *on demand*, when a child unit first asks for it, so
//! `subtree_control` answers "cpu is not enforceable here" on a machine where
//! it is — and answers differently five seconds later. Measured on the L16:
//! `app.slice/cgroup.controllers` is `cpu memory pids` while its
//! `subtree_control` is `memory pids`, and `cpu` appears in the latter the
//! moment any child scope asks for `CPUQuota`.
