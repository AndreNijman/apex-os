//!
//!   * *who is asking* — from [`crate::peer`], never from the request;
//!   * *is this in the vocabulary* — from [`apex_agent_core::request::Verb`],
//!     which cannot express an arbitrary command;
//!   * *has a human already allowed exactly this here* — from the grant store.

//! privileged daemon. An approved request is run by `apex request approve`
//! under the approving human's own root, and the daemon only records that it
