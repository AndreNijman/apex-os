//! Running a session inside a disposable capsule (§19, §P1-037).
//!
//! ## Why the daemon does this and not the CLI
//!
//! `apex disposable run -- apex agent run …` composes the two verbs by hand
//! and is the WRONG answer, which is worth writing down because it is the
//! first thing anybody tries. The daemon spawns the session's PTY on the
//! host, and `/run/user/<uid>` is bind-mounted into every capsule — so an
//! `apex agent run` issued from inside a capsule reaches the host daemon and
//! the agent starts OUTSIDE the environment. The capsule would be an empty
//! gesture around a client that immediately left it.
//!
//! So the wrap happens where the process is actually spawned: the session's
//! PTY child becomes the disposable ENGINE, and the adapter runs inside it.
//!
//! ## What that buys, none of which is new code
//!
//! The engine (`/usr/libexec/apex-disposable`) already creates the capsule
//! with a throwaway home, copies in, and tears the whole thing down from a
//! `trap` on EXIT, INT and TERM. Making it the PTY child means:
//!
//! * teardown happens on every exit path the daemon can cause, including the
//!   SIGTERM of `apex agent kill` — the TERM trap exits 143 and the EXIT trap
//!   fires. The daemon needs no teardown hook of its own, and does not get to
//!   have a second, less tested one;
//! * the name validation, the four fences on the recursive removal, and the
//!   copy-out boundary are the engine's, unchanged.
//!
//! If the DAEMON dies mid-session the engine dies with it and its EXIT trap
//! runs; if the machine loses power, the leftover is what
//! `apex disposable list` and `apex disposable purge` exist for. That is the
//! honest bound on the guarantee and it is documented rather than papered
//! over.
//!
//! ## Where the environments live, and the one collision to know about
//!
//! The engine resolves its root from `APEX_DISPOSABLE_ROOT`, else from the
//! DAEMON's `$XDG_STATE_HOME` — normally the same directory the user's own
//! `apex disposable list` reads, because it is the same account, but it is the
//! daemon's value and not the terminal's.
//!
//! The name is derived from the session id, so it is predictable, and the
//! engine refuses to reuse a directory that already exists. Session ids start
//! again at 1 when the daemon restarts, so a leftover from a machine that lost
//! power can collide with a new session's name: the engine then exits with
//! "an environment called 'disp-agent1' already exists" on the session's own
//! terminal, and `apex disposable purge` clears it. Loud and diagnosable, and
//! preferred over a random name that no longer says which session owned it.
//!
//! ## A throwaway environment, NOT a security boundary
//!
//! distrobox mounts the host's root filesystem at `/run/host` inside every
//! capsule — that is how `distrobox-export` reaches back out to write a
//! `.desktop` file, and there is no flag that removes it — and the process
//! runs as the user's own uid. Code in a disposable capsule can therefore
//! read and write the real `$HOME`. What is disposable is the ENVIRONMENT.
//!
//! For confinement the mechanism is `policy.sandbox`, and the two are
//! REFUSED together rather than combined: bwrap wrapping the capsule engine
//! confines the container client, not the agent, so the pair would read as
//! "confined and disposable" and deliver neither.
