//! `Request::Clipboard`: read what is on this machine's clipboard (P1-059
//! criterion 3, the receive half).
//!
//! The refusals and the arithmetic that shape this verb are on
//! [`apex_agent_core::protocol::Request::Clipboard`] and on
//! [`crate::privilege::refuse_clipboard`]. This file is the I/O: finding a
//! compositor to ask, asking it without being able to hang, and turning what
//! comes back into one response.
//!
//! ## The daemon does not have a display, and that is not a bug to route
//! around
//!
//! Measured on a live `apex-agentd`: its environment holds `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`
//! and `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` and **no `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`**, while the
//! user's own service manager reports `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1`.
//! `apex-agentd.service` says why in its own comments: the runtime is useful
//! in a bare TTY, so it deliberately does not order itself after
//! `graphical-session.target` — it is usually running before a compositor
//! exists to import that variable, and nothing imports it afterwards.
//!
//! So a `Command::new("wl-paste")` with the daemon's environment does not read
//! an empty clipboard. It fails with *"Failed to connect to a Wayland server …
//! falling back to wayland-0"*, and a verb that reported that as "your
//! clipboard is empty" would be lying about the one thing it exists to report.
//! [`display`] finds the socket instead.
//!
//! ## Why the socket is probed rather than globbed
//!
//! The machine this was written on has two: `wayland-1`, live, and
//! `wayland-2`, left behind by a compositor that exited on a previous day.
//! Picking the first name that matches a pattern is a coin toss between them,
//! and the losing side of that toss is a user told their session has no
//! display while they are looking at it. A `connect(2)` separates them for
//! certain — a stale socket answers `ECONNREFUSED` immediately, measured, so
//! the probe costs nothing and cannot hang.
//!
//! `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, if something ever does set it for this daemon, is tried
//! first and is probed like any other candidate. An environment variable is a
//! claim about the world, not the world.
//!
//! ## The bounded wait is the important line in this file
//!
//! `wl-paste` does not read a buffer the compositor holds. Wayland's clipboard
//! is a *promise*: the compositor hands over a file descriptor and the
//! application that owns the selection writes the bytes into it, whenever it
//! gets round to it. An application that is wedged — the state in which
//! somebody is most likely to reach for their phone — never writes, and
//! `wl-paste` waits for it forever.
//!
//! For a phone that is not one slow request. `apex-remoted` calls `control()`
//! inline in its frame loop (`serve.rs:352`) with a 300-second socket timeout
//! (`proxy.rs:50`), so an unbounded read here freezes the whole device
//! connection — the terminal with it — for five minutes, on a verb the user
//! could have skipped. [`READ_SECS`] bounds it, the child is killed, and the
//! refusal says which clock ran out.
