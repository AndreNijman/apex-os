//! The live session table.
//!
//! One [`Session`] per PTY, each with its own reader thread. A `Mutex` per
//! session rather than one lock over the table, so a busy agent producing
//! megabytes of output never blocks `apex agent list`.
//!
//! Locking rule, and the reason this stays deadlock-free: the registry lock is
//! held long enough to clone an `Arc` out of the map, and — once per session
//! start — long enough to reserve an id against the store, which is a directory
//! listing and one exclusive create. Session locks are taken *after* the
//! registry lock is released, never the other way round, and no code path holds
//! two session locks at once.
