//! `apex-agentd` — the APEX agent runtime.
//!
//! Unprivileged, one per user, started by `systemd --user`. It owns the PTYs
//! that agent sessions run on, the sandbox each session is confined by, the
//! project and checkpoint state around them, and the control socket the `apex`
//! CLI and APEX Shell talk to.
//!
//! It deliberately holds no privilege and never talks to `apexd`. Agent
//! orchestration inside the privileged daemon is the thing the roadmap
//! forbids; when a session eventually needs a system change, that will be a
//! narrow request to the frozen `org.apexos.Apexd1` surface, made by the user's
//! own `apex` invocation, not a right this process holds.
//!
//! Threading: one thread accepting connections, one per connection, one per
//! session. Sessions are few and the work is I/O, so this is simpler and more
//! predictable than an async runtime — and the blocking `read` on a PTY is
//! exactly what the kernel is good at.
