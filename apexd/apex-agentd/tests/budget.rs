//! §P2-011 against a real daemon.
//!
//! Everything that is a property of a value is tested beside the code in
//! `budget.rs`. Three claims are not properties of a value, and they are why
//! this file spawns a process:
//!
//! * **that the default really is untouched.** The argv of an unbudgeted
//!   session is supposed to be byte-identical to what it was before the hook
//!   existed. The observable for that is not the argv — it is the cgroup the
//!   session's process actually ends up in, which must be the daemon's own.
//!   A unit test can only say what `wrap` returned.
//!
//! * **that a refusal reaches the client.** A budget that cannot be delivered
//!   refuses the session, and the sentence saying why has to survive the error
//!   chain, `run_error`'s classification and the socket. A refusal that is
//!   correct in `budget.rs` and arrives as `bad request: error` is not a
//!   refusal anybody can act on.
//!
//! * **that the limits are written on a real cgroup** — the only claim that
//!   proves the feature does anything at all.
//!
//! ## Why the last one is opt-in
//!
//! `systemd-run --user` needs a user manager, and it finds one at
//! `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/systemd/private`. **Measured: when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is
//! set and that path is missing, it does NOT fall back to
//! `$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`** — a correct bus address plus a fixture
//! runtime directory still fails. Since this harness gives its daemon its own
//! `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (and must: sharing the real one would mean binding the
//! live daemon's socket path), the child it starts cannot reach a user manager
//! unless the harness lends it one by symlink.
//!
//! Doing that is fine on a developer's machine and meaningless in a container
//! with no user manager at all, so the live half runs only under
//! `APEX_BUDGET_LIVE=1` and is deliberately **not** in `pr-validation.yml`.
//! The three tests above it need no bus, no privilege and no prompt, and are.
//!
//! Every daemon here gets its own `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`,
//! `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `APEX_AGENT_SCRATCH_ROOT`. It never touches a running
//! `apex-agentd`, and it is killed by pid — never by name.
