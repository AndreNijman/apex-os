//! `apex git-shim` — the `git` a managed session finds first on its PATH.
//!
//! §12's constraint is that the user's existing skills keep using normal tools:
//! a skill runs `git push`, and it works, and nobody rewrites it around
//! `apex secret use github git-push origin`. This is how.
//!
//! The daemon writes a two-line `git` into the session's scratch directory and
//! puts that directory first on the session's `PATH`. It runs this. For the
//! three operations the broker has a capability for — `push`, `fetch`,
//! `ls-remote` — against a remote whose URL is `http(s)` and whose host has a
//! stored credential, it asks the broker to perform the operation. For
//! everything else it `exec`s the real git and gets out of the way.
//!
//! ## What it is not
//!
//! **Not a security boundary.** It holds no credential and enforces nothing.
//! The agent can run `/usr/bin/git` directly, and the only thing that happens
//! is that git has no credential and the remote answers `401`. Every check that
//! matters is in `apex-secretd`: the grant, the host pin, the URL resolved from
//! the repository rather than from the caller. This is a convenience, and it is
//! important to say so, because a shim that looked like enforcement would be
//! the kind of thing somebody later relies on.
//!
//! **Not a translation layer.** Anything the capability model does not express
//! falls through to git rather than being approximated: a refspec, a `--force`,
//! a `clone` of a URL. The capability vocabulary is closed on purpose, and the
//! wrong way to widen it is one argument at a time inside a wrapper.
//!
//! ## Falling through, and when not to
//!
//! An ssh remote, a public repository, a remote on a host with no stored
//! credential: all of those work today without a credential, and a shim that
//! turned them into "not granted" would break more than it fixed. So the
//! broker's `NoSuchService`, `HostMismatch` and "not an http remote" answers
//! all fall through to real git.
//!
//! A refusal does not. "This capability is not granted for this project" is the
//! answer the person needs; running git afterwards would replace it with git's
//! own authentication failure, which says nothing about grants and sends the
//! reader looking in the wrong place.
