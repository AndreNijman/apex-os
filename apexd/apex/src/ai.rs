//! `apex ai` — the client half of §14's local inference service.
//!
//! Six verbs, and each one is either a *pure decision* rendered through
//! `apexd_core::ai`, a read of the model store, or a request to the per-user
//! daemon. Nothing here reimplements a policy: the backend choice, the VRAM fit
//! and the pull provenance rules all come from that module, so what this prints
//! is what the daemon does.
//!
//! ── The parse/execute split, and why it is not tidiness ────────────────────
//!
//! `apex ai run --on desktop` is coming, and it is not this branch's job. What
//! *is* this branch's job is making sure the remote form is a thin wrapper
//! rather than a second argument parser:
//!
//! ```text
//! RunArgs  --plan_run(args, stdin)-->  RunPlan  --run_local(plan)-->  exit code
//!                                          \--run_remote(host, plan)-->  later
//! ```
//!
//! [`plan_run`] is pure and total: it takes the parsed flags and whatever was
//! piped in, and returns either a [`RunPlan`] or a refusal. It opens nothing.
//! [`RunPlan::request_body`] then renders exactly the JSON that goes on the
//! wire. A remote executor swaps only the last arrow — and because the plan is
//! a value with an asserted shape, the two cannot come to disagree about what a
//! given command line means.
//!
//! ── Why this file contains an HTTP client and the daemon does not ──────────
//!
//! The API endpoint relays the backend's own HTTP API untouched, which is what
//! lets any OpenAI-compatible client use it. Somebody has to speak that
//! protocol, and the right somebody is the *client*: putting it in the daemon
//! would mean the daemon parsing requests it is supposed to forward verbatim.
//!
//! So there is a small HTTP/1.1 client here — request builder, header parser,
//! chunked-transfer decoder, server-sent-events splitter — and every piece of
//! it is a pure function over bytes with unit tests, because a streaming parser
//! that is subtly wrong drops the last token of every answer and nothing
//! notices.
//!
//! ── STATED LIMITATION: a client that only accepts a base URL cannot reach it ─
//!
//! The endpoint is a Unix socket, and that is a deliberate security decision
//! with a real cost that belongs written down rather than discovered.
//!
//! **What works.** Anything that can be told to dial a Unix socket. `curl
//! --unix-socket <path>` (verified present in this image's curl, alongside
//! `--abstract-unix-socket`) is the reference form and is what
//! [`serve`](AiCmd::Serve) prints. HTTP libraries that expose their transport —
//! a custom dialer, a `socketPath`, a UDS transport — can be pointed at it the
//! same way, and `apex ai run` itself is proof the protocol needs nothing
//! special.
//!
//! **What does not.** An SDK whose entire configuration surface is
//! `base_url = "http://host:port"` has nowhere to put a path. That is a genuine
//! gap in §14's "allow agent clients to use local inference through the same
//! service": such a client cannot use it without a bridge.
//!
//! **Why APEX ships no bridge.** A TCP listener forwarding to the socket would
//! restore exactly the exposure the endpoint refuses — a port on 127.0.0.1 with
//! no peer credential, open to every account on the machine and to every
//! sandboxed application holding the network permission — and it would do so
//! under an `apex` verb, which would read as APEX having decided it was safe.
//! It is not safe; it is a trade. So the trade is *printed* instead, as the
//! `socat` line that makes it, with the consequence stated next to it. A person
//! who wants it can have it in one command, and the command and its cost live
//! in the same place.
//!
//! The bridge APEX does provide is the remote one: `apex ai run --on <host>`
//! over §20's ssh transport, where the credential is the user's own ssh
//! identity rather than the absence of one.
