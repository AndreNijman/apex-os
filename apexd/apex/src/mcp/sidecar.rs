//! §10.2 — one confinement per MCP server, rather than the session's.
//!
//! An MCP server is a program the agent starts, and today it starts inside the
//! agent's own sandbox and gets everything that sandbox has: the project
//! writable, the network open, the toolchain caches, the agent's profile. A
//! memory server that stores notes in one file therefore runs with write access
//! to the source tree, and `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` is a
//! package fetched from a registry at first run — third-party code with the
//! agent's reach.
//!
//! ```text
//! "memory": {"command": "apex",
//!            "args": ["mcp", "run", "memory", "--",
//!                     "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]}
//! ```
//!
//! [`build`] turns a policy into a [`SandboxSpec`] and hands it to
//! [`apex_agent_core::sandbox::build_argv`] — the same function that confines an
//! agent session, and the only one. A second bubblewrap profile in this
//! codebase would be a second thing to get wrong, and the argv it produced
//! would drift from the one that is tested.
//!
//! ## The three dimensions, and what each is actually worth
//!
//! **Filesystem.** Default-deny, and it costs nothing extra: `build_argv`
//! already masks `$HOME`, `/run` and `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and binds back only
//! what a spec lists. What this adds is a *different* home — a private
//! directory per server, under the runtime's state — so a server that writes
//! beside itself writes there and nowhere the agent or the next server can see.
//! The project root is not bound unless the policy asks.
//!
//! **Network.** Default `--unshare-net`, which is the whole of the kernel
//! enforcement. `network = true` gives the server the *parent's* namespace, and
//! that is a ceiling rather than a grant: a namespace cannot be un-shared
//! upward, so a server declared `network = true` inside an offline session
//! still has none. An MCP server cannot be used as a way out of a session that
//! was confined without one.
//!
//! **Secrets.** The honest answer is narrower than the word suggests. The
//! sidecar runs as the agent's own account, so neither `apex-agentd` nor
//! `apex-secretd` can tell it apart from the agent — a credential it could
//! fetch is a credential the agent could fetch, and `/proc/<pid>/environ` is
//! readable to the same uid either way. **Per-MCP identity at the broker does
//! not exist**, and nothing here pretends otherwise. What *is* enforceable is
//! reachability: the daemons' sockets live under `/run` and
//! `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, both masked, so by default a server cannot open either.
//! `broker = true` binds the secret service's socket back, and the grant table
//! then decides as it always did.
//!
//! ## What this is a boundary against, and what it is not
//!
//! It confines the MCP server's own code. It is **not** a boundary against a
//! hostile agent: `~/.claude.json` is bound writable into a session, because
//! Claude records onboarding state in it, so a session can rewrite a definition
//! to drop the wrapper — and could have run the same program directly in any
//! case. Closing that means starting the agent with `--strict-mcp-config
//! --mcp-config <a file the daemon wrote>`, which is a change to how sessions
//! are launched and is named as a remainder rather than half-done here.
//!
//! The policy file is read-only inside a session for the same reason it is
//! worth having: an agent that could rewrite it could widen every server's
//! confinement at once.
