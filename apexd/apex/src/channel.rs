//! `apex channel` — which update channel this machine follows, moving between
//! them safely in both directions, and the health signal that stops a rollout.
//! Roadmap §26.
//!
//! ## What is here and what is honestly not
//!
//! **Here.** Four channels as four tags on the one repository, a readout that
//! tells a machine where it actually stands, `set` in both directions with the
//! backwards one pinning the current deployment first, a health verdict taken
//! from the machine after an update, and a gate that refuses to advance a
//! machine that came back broken.
//!
//! **Not here, and not pretended.** No health report is transmitted anywhere.
//! `apex channel report` prints the exact payload it would send and says that
//! no endpoint is configured, because APEX operates no telemetry service and
//! writing a URL into the source would not create one. The opt-in is real —
//! `report = false` in `~/.config/apex/channel.toml`, and an `endpoint` the
//! user sets themselves — and with nothing configured the answer is that
//! nothing leaves the machine.
//!
//! Nor is there a fleet-wide rollout ramp. `apexd_core::channel::admits` and
//! the machine's bucket are real and tested, and the percentage is read from
//! the image's own label; but a label is baked once per build, so the ramp
//! needs a mutable pointer that does not exist. The gate stops a rollout on
//! this machine, which is the half that can be true without a server.
//!
//! ## The stop is a refusal, not a notification
//!
//! §26's second criterion is that a rollout can stop. On one machine that
//! means: after an update, if the machine came back with a regression the
//! update could have caused, `apex update` refuses to take it further and
//! points at `sudo apex rollback`. Advancing a machine that is already broken
//! is how one bad release becomes two, and the user is at the keyboard of the
//! machine that would do it.
