//! `apex boot status` — what verified this boot, and what the boot counter
//! currently believes. Roadmap §22's "surface boot verification state in APEX
//! Settings", from the OS side.
//!
//! ## Read-only, root-free, and honest about what it cannot see
//!
//! Everything here is a file read or one `bootctl list` invocation. There is no
//! mutating form: `apex boot status` is what APEX Settings polls, and "what is
//! the state of my boot chain" must never cost a password.
//!
//! Two of the interesting facts do need root, because they live in the ESP,
//! which is mode 0700 on an APEX machine. When that read fails this reports
//! `"entries": null` together with the reason, and it does NOT substitute an
//! empty list. The difference matters: an empty entry list is
//! indistinguishable from "no deployment has failed", which is precisely the
//! answer that would hide a rollback from the user.
//!
//! ## Why it reports the health verdict instead of recomputing it
//!
//! `/usr/libexec/apex-boot-health` decides whether a boot was healthy, because
//! it is the unit systemd runs before `boot-complete.target` and its exit
//! status is what blesses or condemns the deployment. Recomputing the verdict
//! here would give two implementations that can disagree, and the one the user
//! reads would be the one that is not wired to anything. So the verdict is
//! read out of the file that unit wrote, and a missing file is reported as
//! "never ran" rather than as "healthy".
//!
//! ## The bootloader this expects to find
//!
//! GRUB, on every published image. §22's recommendation is to keep it for this
//! generation and AGENTS.md's boot-path rule 5 makes that a contract, so
//! `bootloader: "grub"` with `bootCounting: false` is the normal, correct
//! answer and the report says so in plain words rather than looking like a
//! degraded state.
