//! Sigstore verification, and the gate that refuses an image which fails it.
//!
//! `trust.rs` answers "has anybody checked this image?". Until this module
//! existed the answer on every APEX machine was no, and the reason was not
//! philosophical: the cryptographic arm of `apex trust --verify` keyed off
//! `/usr/bin/cosign` existing, and **cosign is not packaged for Fedora**.
//! `dnf5 repoquery cosign 'cosign*' 'sigstore*'` is empty across fedora,
//! updates, updates-archive and both RPM Fusion repositories, so that branch
//! was dead code on every machine this project can ship to, and the report
//! always ended "…were not checked".
//!
//! It turns out cosign is not needed. A cosign keyless signature is an OCI
//! artifact whose parts are all standard, and the two tools that read them —
//! `skopeo` and `openssl` — are already in the image. So this module verifies
//! the signature itself.
//!
//! ## What a signature verification consists of here
//!
//! For the `.sig` artifact of a digest, every one of these must hold:
//!
//! 1. the payload blob's sha256 equals the layer digest that named it;
//! 2. the ECDSA signature in `dev.cosignproject.cosign/signature` verifies
//!    over that blob under the public key of the leaf certificate in
//!    `dev.sigstore.cosign/certificate`;
//! 3. the leaf chains to a **pinned** Fulcio root — [`FULCIO_ROOT`], shipped by
//!    the image — with the `dev.sigstore.cosign/chain` annotation supplied only
//!    as untrusted intermediates;
//! 4. the leaf's subject alternative name is the identity this machine expects,
//!    and its Sigstore OIDC-issuer extension is the issuer it expects;
//! 5. the payload binds the digest being verified and the repository it came
//!    from — `critical.image.docker-manifest-digest` and
//!    `critical.identity.docker-reference`.
//!
//! Any of those answering "no" is a failure. Any of them failing to *run* —
//! openssl missing, the pinned root unreadable, the registry unreachable — is
//! not a failure, and is not a pass either. See [`Verdict`].
//!
//! ### The `-attime` trap
//!
//! A Fulcio leaf lives for **ten minutes**. The one on the image the author's
//! L16 is running was valid from 13:43:25 to 13:53:25 on 2026-09-05 and has
//! been expired ever since, so `openssl verify` at the current time reports
//! "certificate has expired" for a perfectly good signature. Verification must
//! therefore be done at a past instant, and *which* instant is a security
//! decision:
//!
//! * The `dev.sigstore.cosign/bundle` annotation carries Rekor's
//!   `integratedTime`, which is the honest answer — but that annotation is not
//!   covered by anything this module verifies, so an attacker who can serve a
//!   manifest can put any number in it. Using it would let a signature made
//!   with a leaked ephemeral key long after its window verify anyway.
//! * The leaf's own `notBefore` is inside the certificate, and the certificate
//!   is authenticated by the chain in step 3. That is what this module uses.
//!
//! What is given up by not verifying the Rekor entry is transparency-log
//! inclusion: this module cannot tell that the signature was ever published to
//! a log, only that a certificate issued to the expected identity signed this
//! exact digest. That is the same posture as `cosign verify
//! --insecure-ignore-tlog`, and the report says so in those words rather than
//! printing an unqualified "verified".
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! The `.att` artifact is a DSSE envelope wrapping an in-toto statement whose
//! predicate is the syft SPDX SBOM. It is verified the same way, over the DSSE
//! pre-authentication encoding, and the statement's subject must be the digest.
//!
//! **No published APEX image has one yet.** The `cosign attest` step exists
//! only on `roadmap/v2.2`; `origin/main`'s `build-image.yml` has no `syft` and
//! no `attest`, and `skopeo inspect` on the booted digest's `.att` tag returns
//! `manifest unknown`. So provenance is `Absent` on every machine today, which
//! is why the shipped default treats it as advisory — see [`Enforcement`].
//!
//! Because that also means the attestation path could not be exercised against
//! a real artifact, an envelope this module cannot parse is reported as
//! [`Verdict::CouldNotRun`] and never as a failure. A format that turns out to
//! differ from the one assumed here must not refuse the first genuinely signed
//! image that carries it.
