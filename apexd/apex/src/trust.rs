//! `apex trust` — is the image this machine is running the one APEX published,
//! and how much of that has anybody checked?
//!
//! Roadmap §27 asks for supply-chain verification and says "`apex status`
//! should surface trust state clearly". The half that already exists is
//! producer-side: `build-image.yml` cosign-signs every published digest under a
//! keyless GitHub identity, attaches an SPDX SBOM as a signed attestation, and
//! verifies its own work before moving a tag. None of that reaches the machine.
//!
//! ## The three questions, kept apart
//!
//! A trust readout that answers them as one number is the readout that lies.
//!
//! 1. **What was checked when this image was pulled?** ostree records the
//!    answer in the deployment's own origin file, as the prefix on
//!    `container-image-reference`. `ostree-unverified-registry:` means the pull
//!    checked a content digest and nothing else — no signature, no identity.
//!    This is a fact about the past, it needs no network, and it cannot change.
//! 2. **What will be checked on the next pull?** `/etc/containers/policy.json`,
//!    which is what `bootc upgrade` consults. A machine can be running an image
//!    nobody verified and still be configured to verify the next one, or the
//!    reverse.
//! 3. **Does the registry hold a signature for the digest we are running?**
//!    The only question that needs the network, so it is the only one behind
//!    `--verify`. Everything else is answered offline, every time.
//!
//! ## Absence, refusal and distance are three different answers
//!
//! `apex boot status` already refuses to let a refused read report as a
//! measurement, and `docs/boot-v2.md` states the rule: an empty entry list is
//! indistinguishable from "no deployment has failed". Trust has the same shape
//! and worse stakes, so every fact here is `Option` plus a reason rather than a
//! defaulted `false`:
//!
//! - **offline** — the registry could not be reached. Reported as
//!   `unavailable` with the transport error. It is never `unsigned`.
//! - **unsigned** — the registry answered, and has no signature for this
//!   digest. That is the substituted-image signal, and it is a claim only
//!   after a round trip that succeeded.
//! - **present but unchecked** — a signature artifact exists and this machine
//!   has no `cosign`, so its cryptography was not checked here. The identity
//!   printed in that state is what an unverified certificate asserts about
//!   itself, and the report says so in those words rather than promoting it to
//!   "signed by".
//!
//! ## No root, no daemon, no prompt for the offline half
//!
//! `bootc status` requires root even to read (it opens the sysroot for write),
//! so it is unusable from a command APEX Settings polls. Every offline fact
//! here is a file read or a `readlink` of a world-readable path, which is why
//! the trust block can sit inside `apex status` without turning it into a
//! privileged command.
