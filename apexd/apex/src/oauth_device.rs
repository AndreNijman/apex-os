//! RFC 8628, the OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant, for any authorisation
//! server in [`apex_secret_core::account::OAUTH`].
//!
//! ```text
//! apex cf connect                  # Cloudflare, through this
//! apex account add google.work     # Google and Microsoft, through this
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why it is here and not in `cloudflare.rs`
//!
//! It was in `cloudflare.rs`, because Cloudflare was the only provider that
//! had one. Nothing in the flow is Cloudflare's: §3.1 asks a device endpoint
//! for a code, §3.4 polls a token endpoint until something decides, and §3.5
//! says what `slow_down` means. What *was* Cloudflare's — the service names the
//! two tokens are filed under, the API host the access token is pinned to, the
//! words printed afterwards — stays in `cloudflare.rs`, which calls this.
//!
//! The split is the point rather than tidiness. `apex account add` for a
//! `Flow::DeviceCode` provider is the same flow against a different
//! authorisation server, and a second copy of a poll loop is a second place for
//! §3.5's "add five seconds, permanently" to be got wrong. One copy also means
//! one set of loopback tests covers both callers.
//!
//! ## Nothing here is launched, and nothing here is stored
//!
//! The verification URL and the user code are **printed**. A browser on this
//! machine is the thing the device grant exists to avoid — P2-018 is the item
//! next to this one, and a machine with no working graphics still has to be
//! able to sign in. And this module hands its caller a [`Grant`]; where the
//! tokens go, and under what names, is the caller's decision because it is the
//! caller that knows which credential is which.
