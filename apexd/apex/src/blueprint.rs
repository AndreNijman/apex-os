//! `apex blueprint` — where the blueprint lives, what the machine actually is,
//! and how the two differ.
//!
//! [`apexd_core::blueprint`] holds the schema and the pure planner and touches
//! nothing. This module is the other half: it finds the files, *measures* the
//! machine, and renders the result. The split is the same one `apexd-core`
//! already uses for power tiers — plan in the pure crate, touch from outside —
//! and it is what lets the planner be exhaustively unit-tested with no machine.
//!
//! ── The three files, and which one is authoritative ─────────────────────────
//!
//! ```text
//!   ~/.config/apex/blueprint.toml        DESIRED   — you edit this
//!   /etc/apex/blueprint.toml             DESIRED   — site default, used when
//!                                                    the user has no file
//!   ~/.local/state/apex/blueprint-state.toml
//!                                        APPLIED   — generated, never read as
//!                                                    intent
//! ```
//!
//! Observed state has no file on purpose. `diff` probes the machine every time,
//! because a cached "current state" is how a converger ends up agreeing with
//! itself: a step that silently did nothing would report converged forever.
