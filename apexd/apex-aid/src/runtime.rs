//! Finding, confining, starting and stopping the inference runtime.
//!
//! The runtime is **not in the image** — see `apexd_core::ai`'s module docs —
//! so the first job here is to look for one and, when there is none, produce
//! the exact command that installs it. Nothing in this file downloads, builds
//! or unpacks anything: `AGENTS.md` forbids a second package mechanism and P1
//! already shipped both of the ones the hint names.
//!
//! ── Why the backend is confined, and what that buys ────────────────────────
//!
//! The backend is a large C++ program that maps untrusted weights, parses HTTP
//! from anything that can open the API socket, and holds the user's prompts. It
//! needs: its own binary and libraries, one read-only model file, one socket
//! directory, and a GPU device. It does **not** need the network, the user's
//! home, or a writable filesystem.
//!
//! So it is started under `bubblewrap` with `--unshare-net`, and that flag is
//! the load-bearing one. A path-named `AF_UNIX` socket is unaffected by network
//! namespaces — only the abstract namespace is per-netns — so the daemon still
//! reaches the backend through the filesystem while the backend's network is
//! its own.
//!
//! ── What `--unshare-net` does and does NOT do, measured ────────────────────
//!
//! Stated precisely, because the imprecise version invites the wrong test. The
//! backend can still *create* and *bind* an `AF_INET` socket: `--unshare-net`
//! gives it a private network namespace with its own loopback, not a missing
//! network stack. Verified on the katana — a program inside the sandbox bound
//! `127.0.0.1:18099` successfully.
//!
//! What it cannot do is be reached. From the host, in the same run:
//!
//! ```text
//! inside : bind+listen on 127.0.0.1:18099 succeeded
//! host   : connect to 127.0.0.1:18099 -> ConnectionRefusedError
//! host   : ss -ltn 'sport = 18099'     -> 0 lines
//! ```
//!
//! That is the property §14 needs: no port the backend opens is visible or
//! connectable from any other process on the machine, whatever account it runs
//! as. So "no local account can find a port to connect to" holds by
//! construction rather than by the planner having got `--host` right, and this
//! is the second line behind `apexd_core::ai::plan_launch`'s refusal to emit a
//! TCP address. The unit's `RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX AF_NETLINK` is the
//! third, and that one does remove the ability to create the socket at all.
//!
//! `bubblewrap` is the same security dependency the agent runtime uses, present
//! because flatpak pulls it in and asserted in `Containerfile.base`. When it is
//! genuinely absent the backend runs unconfined and the daemon **says so** in
//! `apex ai status` — a silent downgrade is what `AGENTS.md` forbids, and
//! refusing to serve at all would be worse than a stated weaker posture for a
//! process that is still a per-user, unprivileged child.
