//! One device connection, from the first handshake byte to the last frame.
//!
//! Two shapes arrive on the same listener and are told apart by the first
//! thing the device says: a **pairing** connection, which uses `Noise_NK` and
//! the one-time token, and a **session** connection, which uses `Noise_IK`
//! and an already-paired key. The device announces which in one plaintext
//! byte before the handshake — the only plaintext this protocol has after the
//! length prefix, and it says nothing an observer could not infer from the
//! message sizes anyway.
//!
//! ## What a connection may do, in order
//!
//! 1. Handshake. A session handshake yields the device's static key, which is
//!    looked up in the store. An unknown or revoked key ends the connection
//!    here, before a single frame is read.
//! 2. Frames. Control frames are round-tripped through `rime-agentd` on a
//!    connection that declared its origin first; `Open` starts a PTY channel;
//!    `Data` goes to the PTY it names.
//!
//! There is no step where the device says who it is. It cannot: the identity
//! is what the handshake proved, and every proxied request carries it as the
//! `actor` the daemon records.
//!
//! ## Three threads per connection, and why the frame loop is never the one that waits
//!
//! The **frame loop** reads, decrypts and routes. It answers a `Ping`, times a
//! `Pong`, and writes a `Data` frame to the PTY it names — and it does nothing
//! that can wait on `rime-agentd`. The **worker** takes every `Control` and
//! every `Open`, strictly in the order they arrived, and writes each reply
//! through the same [`Sealer`]. The **pinger** measures the connection and,
//! since `liveness`, ends it when the device stops answering.
//!
//! It used to be one loop doing all of it, and a control request that waited
//! — `CONTROL_TIMEOUT` is five minutes, for the requests a human answers —
//! stopped every terminal on the connection for as long as it waited: no
//! keystroke reached a PTY, no pong was read, and a phone that wanted a
//! terminal to keep moving had to open a second connection per terminal and
//! pay a full handshake each time. The worker is what makes one connection
//! enough (`mux_attach`).
//!
//! **One worker, not one thread per request.** The phone pairs a reply with
//! its request by ORDER alone — there is no request id on the wire — and its
//! queue holds `Open`s as well as `Control`s, because an `Open` is answered
//! on channel zero too (`android/.../link/Mux.kt`, "The ordering rule"). A
//! pool would answer a fast `list` before a slow `approve` sent ahead of it
//! and the phone would show one reply under the other request. So a slow
//! request still delays the replies behind it, which the protocol requires;
//! what it no longer delays is everything that is not a reply.
