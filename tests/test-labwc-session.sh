# APEX-OS — labwc (APEX Floating) session capability matrix.
#
# The roadmap's labwc test matrix, for the part of it a machine can answer.
# Everything here runs a REAL client against a REAL nested labwc using the
# SHIPPED config, because the question is never "does labwc support this
# protocol" in the abstract — it is "does the session we ship actually let a
# client do this". A protocol that is advertised but unusable looks identical to
# one that works, right up until a user tries it.
#
# The application grid from the same section (Firefox, Chromium, Steam,
# gamescope, VS Code, JetBrains, LibreOffice, Blender, Discord, Wine, XWayland
# games) is NOT here and is not claimed. Those need a real GPU session and a
# human looking at the screen; they live in docs/labwc-verification.md as a
# manual checklist. Fabricating them would be worse than leaving them out.
#
# Skips rather than fails when labwc or a probe client is missing, so this is
# safe to run in CI where there is no compositor at all.
#
# Usage: tests/test-labwc-session.sh

      Gamma control (night light) cannot be probed nested: a nested backend has
      no gamma-capable output, so gammastep reports "Zero outputs support gamma
      adjustment" regardless of whether labwc implements the protocol. Needs a
      real session.

      Multi-monitor hotplug, scale, refresh and rotation need real outputs.

      Fullscreen/maximise/minimise behaviour, workspace switching and window
      focus need real windows and a human.

      The application grid (Firefox, Chromium, Steam, gamescope, VS Code,
      JetBrains, LibreOffice, Blender, Discord, Qt/GTK/Electron, Wine, XWayland
      games) is a manual checklist in docs/labwc-verification.md.
