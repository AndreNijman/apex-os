#  check-containerfile-assertions.sh — run the image build's own grep
#  assertions against this repository, before a 50-minute build runs them.
#
#  Four separate assertions on roadmap/v2.2 could never pass or never run, and
#  each one was found the same way: by a `base` job failing at a later step than
#  the last, 50 minutes at a time.
#
#      706489ec  ! grep -q '_keep' … matched the policy file's OWN comment
#      e24cd244  nft -c could not reach netlink in a build container at all
#      43d98f10  ! grep 'mouse = true' matched the three comment lines that
#                explain why `{ mouse = true }` is wrong
#      2e33c1a6  grep 'ApexShellKeybinds.${_variant}' — a draft spelling of a
#                variable that appears nowhere in the file it greps
#
#  All four are the same defect: an assertion nobody has ever watched go red.
#  A Containerfile assertion is the one kind of test that cannot be run by
#  running the test suite, because it only exists inside a build — so this
#  resolves each one back through the Containerfile's own COPY lines to the
#  file in this repo that becomes it, and runs it here.
#
#  It is honest about what it cannot reach. Many stanzas grep a path that only
#  exists after a `sed`, or inside the vendored apex-shell clone, or through a
#  variable built at build time. Those are reported as UNRESOLVED and counted
#  separately — never as passes. "Could not check" is not "fine".
