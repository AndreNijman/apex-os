#  test-apex-storage.sh — executable assertions for roadmap §48's Storage
#  Manager: the read-and-report half.
#
#  ── The three failures this exists to catch ─────────────────────────────────
#
#  1. A DYING DISK REPORTED AS A DISK NOBODY COULD MEASURE. smartctl's exit
#     status is a bitmask. Bits 0-2 mean the read did not happen; bits 3-7 mean
#     it did and the disk is failing. `if status != 0 { unavailable }` turns the
#     one row this whole feature exists for from red into grey.
#
#  2. A PERMANENT FALSE ALARM ABOUT A MACHINE WITH A TERABYTE FREE. On a bootc
#     machine / is a composefs image: 37.8M, 0 available, 100% used, on every
#     APEX machine, forever. Every disk-usage widget ever written points at /.
#
#  3. AN ENCRYPTED DISK CALLED UNENCRYPTED. `blkid` unprivileged exits 0 and
#     prints nothing, so a caller that trusts it reports "not encrypted" for a
#     device it never opened — the one sentence here a user would act on by
#     putting data at risk.
#
#  4. AN ERASE THE GUARD WAVED THROUGH. `apex storage erase` is the only thing
#     in this feature that destroys data, and "is the device mounted?" — the
#     check everybody writes — green-lights destroying THIS machine five
#     independent ways: / is composefs and not a block device at all; the whole
#     disk carrying the OS is a mount source zero times; the ESP is mounted
#     nowhere; an attached loop device is in no mount table anywhere; and one
#     sysfs directory with the wrong mode makes a disk's partitions vanish so
#     that nothing relates the disk to the OS on it. Every one of those was
#     measured on the development machine, and the last two were found by this
#     suite's own fixtures granting a permit.
#
#  Three modes:
#
#    (no argument)     Structural checks with no toolchain.
#    --with-binary     Drives `apex storage` and the notifier against a whole
#                      fixture machine: sysfs, mountinfo, udev records and
#                      captured smartctl output. It DIES if the binary is
#                      absent; a skipped assertion reports as a pass.
#    --destructive     Really erases a device. Opt-in, NOT in pr-validation.yml,
#                      needs `sudo -n`. See the banner on destructive_half.
#
#  NEITHER OF THE FIRST TWO TOUCHES A REAL DISK. Under $APEX_STORAGE_ROOT no
#  subprocess is spawned at all — smartctl's answer, the fstrim timer's state
#  and every filesystem's size come from files this script writes, and the
#  erase path returns before `wipefs` on a fixture root unconditionally.

#  THIS ONE REALLY ERASES A DEVICE. It is opt-in, it is not in
#  pr-validation.yml, and it needs `sudo -n`.
#
#  Every device it touches comes from `losetup --find --show` on a sparse file
#  it created seconds earlier, and it asserts
#  `/sys/block/<dev>/loop/backing_file` is that file before it does anything
#  else at all. That assertion is not belt-and-braces on the development
#  machine: /dev/loop0 there is attached to /lib/extensions/apex-user.raw, a
#  merged system extension carrying 219 packages, so a test that hardcoded a
#  loop device number or took one from argv would erase live machine state.
#
#  `backing_file` is a FILE CONTAINING A PATH, not a symlink. `realpath` on the
#  sysfs node compares a sysfs path against a tmp path and can therefore never
#  match — which fails safe, and means the test silently never runs. Hence the
#  `cat`.
