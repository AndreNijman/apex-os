#  test-apex-firmware.sh — executable assertions for roadmap §P2-015's
#  firmware readout.
#
#  ── The four failures this exists to catch ──────────────────────────────────
#
#  1. A HEALTHY MACHINE READ AS A BROKEN FIRMWARE SUBSYSTEM, or a broken one
#     read as healthy. fwupdmgr's exit status carries no information in either
#     direction, and both halves were measured on the development machine at
#     the same moment: `get-updates --json` with nothing to do exits 0;
#     `get-updates` WITHOUT --json exits 2 with a full device list; and
#     `get-releases --json <a device id that does not exist>` exits 0 with an
#     `Error` object in the body. So the document is the only truth.
#
#  2. A READOUT THAT IS MOSTLY SECURE BOOT BOOKKEEPING. Of 28 rows on this
#     machine, 12 are Secure Boot key and revocation stores, and five separate
#     rows are all called `UEFI Device Firmware`. The obvious filter — keep
#     what is flagged `updatable` — does not work: measured, NINE of eleven
#     updatable rows were certificate stores, and that list contained
#     `KEK CA` twice and `UEFI CA` twice.
#
#  3. A MOMENTARY CONDITION PRINTED AS A CAPABILITY. `updatable` is not a
#     property of a device. Two `get-devices` calls minutes apart on an idle
#     machine returned 11 and then 18 updatable rows, and the seven that
#     changed were EXACTLY the seven that had carried `require-ac-power` — the
#     laptop had been unplugged. On battery, an `[updatable]`/`[read-only]`
#     column reports the System Firmware and the NVMe as things that cannot be
#     updated at all.
#
#  4. A PERMANENT COMPLAINT ON A HEALTHY LAPTOP. Those same seven rows carry
#     `require-ac-power` while NOTHING has an update waiting, so reporting
#     blockers unconditionally puts seven warnings on a machine with nothing to
#     do, for as long as it is on battery. Same shape as warning about the
#     composefs root's 0 bytes free, which §48 already fixed once.
#
#  Two modes, the split the sibling suites use:
#
#    (no argument)     Structural checks with no toolchain.
#    --with-binary     Drives `apex firmware` against captured fwupd
#                      documents. It DIES if the binary is absent; a skipped
#                      assertion reports as a pass.
#
#  NOTHING HERE SPAWNS fwupdmgr. Under $APEX_FIRMWARE_ROOT every answer comes
#  from a file this script writes.

# ── why no check below is `producer | grep -q` ───────────────────────────────
#
#  Under `set -o pipefail` that shape is a COIN FLIP. `grep -q` exits at its
#  first match and SIGPIPEs whatever is feeding it, so the pipeline's status is
#  141 rather than grep's 0, and an `if` reads a match as "no match". Measured
#  under bash against this repo's own `apexd-core/src/firmware.rs`: 40 trials
#  of `sed -E 's://.*$::' "$CORE" | grep -q uefi_capsule` returned **0 twenty
#  times and 141 twenty times**, and this suite's own structural half was
#  21/0 three times and 20/1 nine times out of twelve runs over a tree that
#  never changed.
#
#  Both directions are wrong and one of them is silent: where a match means
#  `bad`, a SIGPIPE turns a real regression into a pass, and no mutation can
#  ever be caught by that check again. So every check that has to look at
#  something other than a plain file CAPTURES the text first and greps the
#  text — command substitution reads its producer to EOF, so there is nobody
#  left to signal.
