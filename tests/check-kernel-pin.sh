#  check-kernel-pin.sh — the kernel pin is only worth something if it is
#  actually pinned, and if the build actually reads it.
#
#  kernel/kernel.pin exists because the COPR build this replaces takes
#  `BuildRequires: dwarves` unversioned and fetches two of its three sources
#  from `master` branch URLs. That is how a kernel that could not load any
#  sched-ext scheduler shipped three times
#  (ROADMAP/evidence/kernel-build-20260920.md).
#
#  A pin file is exactly the kind of artefact that rots into decoration: a URL
#  quietly edited to a branch, a sha left behind when a version moves, a key
#  renamed in the Containerfile and left stale here. None of those fail a build
#  — the build just silently stops being reproducible, which is the original
#  defect wearing the fix's clothes.
#
#  So this runs without a build, and every check fails in BOTH directions:
#  a key the Containerfile reads but the pin does not define is an error, AND
#  a pin key nothing reads is an error.
