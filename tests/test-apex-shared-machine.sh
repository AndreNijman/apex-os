#  test-apex-shared-machine.sh — guest disposability and kiosk policy
#  (roadmap P2-016, criteria 2 and 3).
#
#  ── What it asserts, and why in this shape ──────────────────────────────────
#
#  Two halves, and they are tested differently on purpose.
#
#  **Criterion 3 is an assertion about what is ABSENT.** "Kiosk/shared-device
#  policy is possible without weakening ordinary desktop use" is a claim about
#  the ORDINARY config, so the test is on the shipped
#  files/desktop/apex-greet/greetd-config.toml: it must carry no auto-login
#  stanza. A kiosk recipe that had leaked into the login path would be the
#  criterion failed, and it would fail silently — the machine would still boot,
#  it would just stop asking who you are. The same grep is then applied to the
#  kiosk recipe, where the stanza must be present in the right section, and to
#  a deliberately mutated copy, which must be caught. An assertion about an
#  absence that never sees the presence is an assertion that cannot fail.
#
#  **Criterion 2 is an assertion about BEHAVIOUR**, and it runs the real
#  engine. /usr/libexec/apex-guest-wipe is executed against a fixture tree —
#  a fixture passwd file, a fixture secretd store, a fixture greeter state dir
#  — as an ordinary user, through the overrides its header documents. So the
#  fences are exercised as shipped rather than re-described here.
#
#  ── What it will not do ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#  * It creates no account and modifies no account. `getent passwd` on the
#    machine this was written on lists exactly one account at or above uid
#    1000, and the suite must be as true there as on a machine with twenty.
#    Every account it reasons about is a line in a temp file.
#  * It touches nothing outside its temp directory. The engine is pointed at
#    fixture roots for all four of the paths it can remove, and the suite
#    asserts that redirection worked before it asserts anything about wiping —
#    a suite that silently ran the real thing against /var/lib would be the
#    worst possible outcome of a test for a file that deletes directories.
#  * It starts no compositor, no greeter and no session, and opens no window.
#
#      ./tests/test-apex-shared-machine.sh

# `bash -e {0}`, and under -e an assignment from a command that exits non-zero
