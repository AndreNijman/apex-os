#  check-ci-selector-parity.sh — a push to the integration branch must select
#  the same jobs the merge into `main` would select.
#
#  pr-validation.yml's `changes` job picks its diff base per event. Until
#  2026-09-22 the three arms disagreed about which question they were
#  answering:
#
#    pull_request       base.sha (i.e. `main`) .. PR head   -> the WHOLE branch
#    push               event.before .. new sha             -> ONE push
#    workflow_dispatch  merge-base(origin/main, sha) .. sha -> the WHOLE branch
#
#  So `roadmap/v2.2` could be green on every push for weeks and red the moment
#  it was proposed for merge. It was: `Installer safety and UI` ran on NONE of
#  that branch's 166 push runs, because no single push happened to touch
#  `installer/`, while every merge-shaped classification of the same tree ran
#  it — and found it red.
#
#  This gate executes the REAL `run:` block out of the workflow, against
#  synthetic repositories, and asserts the property in both directions:
#
#    * an integration-branch push selects exactly what the merge PR selects
#      -> fails on the old event.before base, which selects too little
#      -> fails on a base that selects EVERYTHING, which is the other
#         mis-scoping and would put a full matrix on every landing
#    * a TASK-branch push still classifies narrowly
#      -> fails if the fix is applied to every branch instead
#    * the all-zeros (new branch) and unreachable (force push) fallbacks, and
#      the refusal that stops `git diff "" ""` exiting 128, still hold
#    * the in-step integration list equals `on.push.branches`, so a branch
#      added to the trigger cannot silently keep the base that answers the
#      wrong question
#
#  Usage: tests/check-ci-selector-parity.sh [path/to/pr-validation.yml]
#  The argument exists so the same commit can be run against an older copy of
#  the workflow — `git show 'HEAD~1:.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml'` — to
#  demonstrate the gate red.
