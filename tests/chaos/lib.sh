#  The APEX chaos harness — verdicts, diagnostics, and the contract a case
#  must satisfy before the harness will believe anything it says.
#
#  Roadmap P1-062 criterion 3: "failures produce reproducible diagnostics and
#  do not silently corrupt the installation." That criterion is the one that
#  makes the other two worth having, so it is the one this file is about.
#
#  ═══ THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS TO PREVENT ═══
#
#  A chaos harness that reports "no corruption" when it never managed to inject
#  the fault is worse than no harness. It is the same defect this repository
#  has already recorded under "permission denied is not absence" — a read that
#  could not be performed, reported as a fact — except with the stakes of a
#  reliability claim about somebody's operating system.
#
#  So: **every case carries a three-way verdict**, never a boolean.
#
#      survived         the fault was injected, PROVEN to be present by an
#                       observation independent of the injector, the subject
#                       was run, and the subject both kept its state intact
#                       and SAID something about the fault.
#      failed           the fault was injected and proven, the subject ran,
#                       and either its state is corrupt or it carried on
#                       silently. The reason names which.
#      could-not-inject the fault was not proven present, or the subject could
#                       not be run at all. Never a pass. Never a failure.
#
#  This mirrors `apexd/apex/src/verify.rs`'s `Verdict`, which is the house
#  pattern: `Verified` / `Failed` / `CouldNotRun`, and its rule that "any of
#  them failing to *run* is not a failure, and is not a pass either". The one
#  arm dropped here is `Absent`, which has no meaning for an injected fault.
#
#  ═══ THE TWO RULES THAT ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE ═══
#
#  1. `case_prove_injected` is an observation INDEPENDENT of the injector, and
#     is never the injector's exit code. `unshare --net` exiting 0 proves that
#     unshare ran, not that the network is gone; a `connect()` returning
#     ENETUNREACH inside the namespace proves the network is gone. The harness
#     cannot enforce independence syntactically, so every case states in its
#     header what its proof observes and why that is not the injector talking.
#
#  2. A `survived` requires the subject to have SAID something. The incident
#     this whole unit is built around is "a staged ostree deployment is
#     discarded by a crash before clean shutdown" — and the requirement
#     recorded in ROADMAP/state/agents/p1-062.md is that the machine "must come
#     back on the old image *and say so*". A subject that silently absorbs a
#     fault has not survived it; it has hidden it. `expect_says` is how a case
#     asserts that half, and `judge_silent` is the verdict when it is missing.
#
#  ═══ WHAT MAKES A RUN REPRODUCIBLE ═══
#
#  Every run writes a bundle per case under `$CHAOS_OUT/<case>/`:
#
#      verdict.json     {"case","state","reason",...} — the same shape as
#                       `Verdict::to_json`, so one jq expression reads both.
#      seed             the integer every random choice in the case derived from
#      env.txt          kernel, uid, userns/netns/tmpfs/kvm availability,
#                       `apex --version`, the git revision of the tree
#      inject.out/err   the injector's streams
#      observe.out/err  the subject's streams, which are the diagnostics a
#                       human reads when a case goes red
#      baseline.out     the subject's output with NO fault injected, so a red
#                       case can be told apart from a subject that was already
#                       saying that
#      state.before     sha256 of every file in the fixture root, sorted
#      state.after      the same, after the subject ran
#      state.diff       the lines that changed, which is the corruption claim
#
#  `run-chaos --replay <bundle>` re-runs from `seed` and the recorded revision
#  and diffs the verdicts. That is what "reproducible" is allowed to mean here.
#
#  ═══ WHAT THIS HARNESS MAY NOT DO ═══
#
#  AGENTS.md's boot-path rule applies to the harness itself, and
#  tests/test-apex-chaos.sh asserts it rather than trusting this comment: no
#  file under tests/chaos/ may name `bootctl`, `rpm-ostree`, `ostree admin`,
#  `efibootmgr`, or run `apex update`, outside a comment. Every case drives the
#  subject through a FIXTURE ROOT — `APEX_RECOVER_ROOT`, `APEX_TRUST_ROOT` and
#  friends — and the driver refuses a case that invokes `apex` without one.

# describing a check that never ran. This repository has shipped four checks
# satisfied by their own comments; a fifth in the harness whose whole subject
# is "assertions that cannot fail" would be embarrassing.
#
# So the enforcement is now in the only place a case cannot route around:
# `$APEX_BIN` is not the binary. `chaos_write_guard` generates a wrapper, the
# driver exports THAT as `APEX_BIN`, and the wrapper execs the real binary only
# if one of the fixture-root variables below is set in its own environment.
# Otherwise it appends the phase and the argv to a marker file and exits 126,
# and the driver turns a non-empty marker into a harness failure — exit 2, not
# a verdict, because a case that did this has not tested anything.
#
# It holds through `unshare` and through `env`, because it is the executable

# ── structured expectations ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# grep over a rendered report is how a case gets a false pass. It happened on
# this harness's first run, twice in one go:
#
#   * `expect_says "could not be read"` passed for the torn update record
#     because a DIFFERENT row — package extensions — carried that phrase;
#   * `expect_silent_about "nothing to roll back to"` failed for a subject that
#     was right, because the row explaining why it was NOT saying that quoted
#     the phrase inside the explanation.
#
# Both are the same mistake: asserting on prose that was written for a human.
# Where the subject offers a machine-readable document, the assertion reads
# THAT, and the prose assertion is kept only where it is the point (a message a
# person must see).
#
# expect_json WHAT FILE PYEXPR WANT — PYEXPR is evaluated with the parsed
# document bound to `d`; its repr is compared with WANT as a string. A document
# that will not parse is a failed expectation and says so, never a silent pass.
