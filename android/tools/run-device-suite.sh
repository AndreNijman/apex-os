# The broker. `apex-remoted`'s control socket is a unix socket on this machine
# and a phone can never touch one, so this forwards a line of JSON to it and
# forwards the answer back. It decides NOTHING: every offer, every device list
# and every revocation is the daemon's.
#
# `restart_remoted` is the one verb that is not a forward, and it is here
# because "the desktop's service went away" cannot be asked of the service
# itself. It restarts the daemon on the SAME port with the SAME state
# directory, which is what a `systemctl --user restart` does.
#
# `file_privilege_request` and `decide_locally` are the other two, and they are
# the HUMAN AT THIS MACHINE — the person a phone is not. §7 reserves deciding a
# root operation for a local origin, `apex-agentd` enforces that on the wire,
# and a phone therefore cannot produce the state an approvals screen exists to
# show. These two produce it from the computer, where it belongs.
#
# They are deliberately two named verbs with fixed shapes rather than a general
# "forward anything to apex-agentd", which would be a way for a test to borrow a
# local origin for any request at all — and this suite's whole value is that the
# phone's own origin is real.

#
# Asked HERE, before the two-minute APK build, because the answer depends on
# how this script was STARTED and not on anything in the tree.
#
# `apex-remoted` decides whether a human is at the machine by reading the
# connecting peer's cgroup (`origin::classify`), and pairing is one of the
# things §7 reserves for one — pairing hands a phone standing access to every
# agent here. A suite launched from a terminal is observed `local-terminal` and
# pairs; a suite launched by a systemd user unit — a timer, a dispatched agent,
# CI — is observed `scheduled-job` and every offer is refused.
#
# Measured on 2026-09-19 from `apex-roadmap-resume.service`: 24 tests ran and 8
# failed, all eight on `apex-remoted did not mint an offer`. Nothing was wrong
# with the app, the phone or the daemon. The same commit from a login session
# is OK (24 tests). That is two minutes of gradle and twenty seconds of
# instrumentation spent to produce eight failures about the launcher, so the
# question is asked once, up front, through the same broker the tests use.
#
# It is a FAILURE and not a skip, and it names the wrapper that fixes it.
