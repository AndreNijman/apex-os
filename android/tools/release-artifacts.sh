#  release-artifacts.sh — build the APK a person downloads, and refuse to call
#  anything else a release.
#
#  This is deliberately stricter than the same build in `pr-validation.yml`.
#  There, a missing signing key is a NOTICE: a pull request from a fork gets no
#  secrets, the artefacts are built unsigned to prove the release target still
#  compiles, and the job says so. Here, a missing key is a hard failure —
#  because the output of this script is the file somebody installs on their
#  phone, and an unsigned APK is not a release, it is a file that cannot be
#  installed at all.
#
#  WHAT IT EMITS, next to each other in --out:
#
#      apex-remote-<versionName>.apk          the thing you install
#      apex-remote-<versionName>.apk.sha256   what you check it against
#      apex-remote-<versionName>.json         what the app's updater reads
#
#  The `.json` is a contract, not a convenience: the in-app updater fetches it
#  to decide whether a newer build exists, and verifies the APK it then
#  downloads against the `sha256` in it. It also carries the protocol window
#  this build speaks, read out of `Client.kt` rather than repeated here, so the
#  Releases page can state the compatibility promise instead of implying one.
#
#  THE AAB IS BUILT AND NOT PUBLISHED. `verifyReleaseSigning` checks the bundle
#  as well as the APK — a bundle is a jar and needs jarsigner rather than
#  apksigner — and weakening that check to save a minute of build time would
#  leave the artefact a store actually takes unchecked. There is no Play
#  listing today, so it simply is not copied to --out.
#
#  Usage:
#      android/tools/release-artifacts.sh --out DIR --code N --name STRING
#                                         [--tag android-vN]
#
#  Signing comes from the environment, exactly as `app/build.gradle.kts`
#  expects: APEX_KEYSTORE, APEX_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD, APEX_KEY_ALIAS,
#  APEX_KEY_PASSWORD. Nothing here prints any of them.
