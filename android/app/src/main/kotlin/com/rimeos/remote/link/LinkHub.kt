/**
 * The connections this phone holds open, and the keys they were opened with.
 *
 * ## Why this is not the view model's any more
 *
 * "I want it just always connected." A view model lives as long as a screen
 * does; the connection has to live as long as the app is UNLOCKED, which is
 * longer — through the screen going off, through backing out to the launcher
 * — and a foreground service ([LinkService]) is what keeps the process around
 * for that. The service and the screens both need the same links and the same
 * unwrapped keys, so they live here, once per process, and each of the two is
 * a view onto this.
 *
 * ## The key rule has not moved
 *
 * [identities] is IN MEMORY and nowhere else, exactly as it was in the view
 * model: unwrapping a device key needs a biometric prompt, and the unwrapped
 * key never reaches `AppStorage`. What changed is only how long the memory
 * lasts — the process instead of the screen — and the process ends with the
 * app lock ([lock]) or with Android killing it. After either, the next
 * connection needs the prompt again, by design. The service is
 * `START_NOT_STICKY` for the same reason: a process Android restarted on its
 * own has no keys, and a notification saying "connected" over no connection
 * would be a lie.
 *
 * ## Reconnecting
 *
 * A held machine whose link drops is reconnected on [BACKOFF_MS]'s schedule;
 * a network change skips the wait ([onNetworkChanged]). Nothing here prompts:
 * the identity was unwrapped once, on unlock or on the first tap, and every
 * reconnect reuses it.
