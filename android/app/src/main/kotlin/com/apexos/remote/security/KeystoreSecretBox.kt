/**
 * The device key's protection: an AES key the app can use but never read.
 *
 * P1-053 asks that no private key reach insecure app storage, and P1-051 asks
 * for a real second factor. Both land here. The APEX Remote device identity is
 * an X25519 private key, and the Android keystore cannot hold an X25519 key for
 * agreement on any API level this app supports — so the key is *wrapped* with
 * an AES-GCM key that the keystore does hold, and the wrapping key never enters
 * the app's address space. What the app gets is a `Cipher` it may drive; what
 * it never gets is bytes it could copy, print or upload.
 *
 * ## Two levels of gate, and why the split is by API and not by taste
 *
 * The wrapping key is created with `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)`, so
 * using it needs the user present. *How* present differs:
 *
 * * **API 30 and above** — `setUserAuthenticationParameters(0, BIOMETRIC_STRONG
 *   or DEVICE_CREDENTIAL)`. Timeout zero means per-use: every single operation
 *   needs a fresh authentication, and the PIN counts. That is the behaviour
 *   this app wants everywhere.
 * * **API 28 and 29** — the parameter object does not exist, and the older
 *   `setUserAuthenticationValidityDurationSeconds` has one shape that is
 *   per-use (`-1`) and it accepts **biometrics only**. That is not this file's
 *   preference: `androidx.biometric` refuses the combination outright below 30,
 *   in so many words — *"Crypto-based authentication is not supported for
 *   device credential prior to API 30."* [AppLock.authenticators] makes the
 *   same split for the same reason, and the two must not drift apart. A phone
 *   with no enrolled biometric falls back to [insecureFallbackReason] rather
 *   than silently storing a key with no gate at all.
 *
 * ## Both directions are gated, and the earlier claim that sealing was free
 * ## was simply wrong
 *
 * An earlier draft of this file asserted that encryption was exempt from the
 * user-authentication requirement, and used that to avoid a prompt during
 * pairing. It is not exempt. `KeyGenParameterSpec`'s own documentation says of
 * `setUserAuthenticationRequired`: *"This authorization applies only to secret
 * key and private key operations. Public key operations are not restricted."*
 * An AES key is a secret key, so **sealing is gated exactly as opening is** —
 * the exemption is for the public half of an asymmetric pair, which this design
 * does not have. A `seal()` that skipped the prompt would have thrown on a real
 * phone, at the end of pairing, after the desktop had already burnt the token.
 *
 * So there are two prompted pairs: [beginSeal]/[finishSeal] and
 * [beginOpen]/[finishOpen].
 *
 * ## Per-use means the Cipher rides in the prompt
 *
 * A key gated per-use cannot be initialised and then used later: the
 * authentication authorises *one* `Cipher`. `Cipher.init` succeeds — it begins
 * a keystore operation — and it is `doFinal` that needs the operation to have
 * been authorised. So [beginOpen] initialises the cipher, [AppLock] carries it
 * through `BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject`, and the `doFinal` happens on the
 * cipher the prompt hands back. (`UserNotAuthenticatedException` at `init` is
 * the *time-bound* flavour of this gate, which this file deliberately does not
 * use: a window during which the key works is a window during which a phone
 * taken out of a hand works.)
