/**
 * Where a UnifiedPush distributor delivers (P1-058).
 *
 * ## What this class is allowed to decide
 *
 * Almost nothing. Every rule — the action and extra names, whether an endpoint
 * is usable, whether a message is a replay, what an envelope's bytes mean,
 * whether a failure is worth retrying — lives in `:core`, in [Push] and
 * [UnifiedPush], where `PushTest` can reach it. Nothing in this project can
 * test a `BroadcastReceiver`: there is no device, no emulator and no
 * Robolectric, and `assembleDebug` compiles this file without running it. A
 * rule written here would be a rule with no gate in front of it, which is the
 * same reason `Notifier` decides nothing about notification content.
 *
 * ## The one thing this file must get right on its own
 *
 * **It runs with the app not running and the phone probably locked.** So it
 * reads storage itself rather than through a `ViewModel` that does not exist
 * yet, it creates the notification channel itself rather than assuming
 * `MainActivity` ever ran, and it must not throw: an exception here is a
 * process death the user sees as the app crashing whenever a notification
 * arrives. Every parse returns null instead.
 *
 * `onReceive` is on the main thread with roughly ten seconds before the
 * process may be killed. Everything here is a small file read, one AEAD open
 * and one `notify`, so it stays well inside that — and deliberately does NOT
 * open a connection to the machine, which would not.
