/**
 * Every screen this app has that can be composed without a live socket, with
 * the state it would really hold, named once.
 *
 * Named once because the accessibility pass, the large-text pass and the
 * landscape pass must all walk the SAME list. Three lists would drift, and the
 * screen that fell off one of them would be the screen nobody checked.
 *
 * What is NOT here is [com.apexos.remote.ui.term.TerminalScreen], and it is
 * left out rather than stubbed: it is driven by a `TerminalController` that
 * owns a PTY attachment, and half a controller would make the checks below
 * assert something no user ever sees. It has its own walks instead —
 * `TerminalHarnessOnDeviceTest` for the semantics tree and the accessibility
 * framework, `TerminalOnDeviceTest` for a real PTY over Wi-Fi — because both
 * need a controller that is whole.
