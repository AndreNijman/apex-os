/**
 * P1-058 on a phone: a notification this app raises really reaches Android's
 * shade, says the right thing, and says no more than it should.
 *
 * Every assertion below was a JVM test about a data class until now. What is
 * new is `NotificationManager` — the channel really being created, the post
 * really being accepted, the id really collapsing a duplicate — and none of
 * that is decided by this repository's code.
 *
 * ## What this phone says about "encrypted for push infrastructure"
 *
 * P1-058's second criterion asks that notification content be minimised so
 * that push infrastructure does not receive sensitive prompt or code content.
 * It is recorded as vacuously met because APEX has no push transport anywhere
 * — no FCM, no UnifiedPush, no ntfy, no subscribe verb — and this device makes
 * that statement sharper rather than weaker: **Google Play services IS
 * installed here** (`com.google.android.gms`, GrapheneOS's sandboxed build), so
 * FCM is available on this phone and the app still does not use it. The
 * minimisation is therefore real and unconditional: these notifications are
 * built on the phone, from state the phone already holds, and nothing about
 * them leaves it.
 *
 * `every_notification_this_app_can_raise_carries_no_prompt_or_code` asserts the
 * minimisation itself, so it holds whatever transport ever appears.
