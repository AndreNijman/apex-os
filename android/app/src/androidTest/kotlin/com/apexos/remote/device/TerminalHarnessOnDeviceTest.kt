/**
 * The terminal, in the standard Compose harness, with no machine on the other
 * end.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * Round 33 recorded that `TerminalScreen` **cannot** be hosted by
 * `createAndroidComposeRule`: the repaint loop left the `Recomposer`
 * permanently busy, so `setContent` never returned from its own
 * `waitForIdle` — `IdlingResourceTimeoutException … hadRecomposerChanges =
 * true`, measured on a Pixel 7a, on all three tests that tried. That was true,
 * and it was a defect in the screen rather than a limit of the harness. Two
 * things caused it and both are fixed:
 *
 * 1. the repaint loop asked for a frame unconditionally, every frame, for ever
 *    — now it waits for a change first (`TerminalFrames`, with the rules
 *    asserted in `:app`'s JVM suite);
 * 2. the hidden input field's `cursorBrush` was `SolidColor(Color.Transparent)`,
 *    and foundation only skips the blink animation for `Color.Unspecified`, so
 *    an invisible cursor was being animated for ever on a focused field.
 *
 * **This test is the assertion that both are really fixed on a phone.** Its
 * subject is not what the screen shows; it is that the harness returns at all.
 * A regression in either cause makes every method below hang inside
 * `setContent` and fail on the rule's own timeout.
 *
 * ## Why no machine
 *
 * `TerminalOnDeviceTest` drives a real PTY over Wi-Fi and is the evidence for
 * P1-055 C1 and C3. This one is about the harness and the semantics tree, and
 * both of those are decided before a byte crosses the network — so `connect`
 * blocks for ever on a latch, the screen sits in `Connecting…`, and the
 * terminal is fed directly. A `connect` that *threw* would be worse than
 * useless here: it would start the reconnect backoff and fill the run with
 * `Lost` events that have nothing to do with what is being asserted.
 *
 * ## NOT RUN when this was written
 *
 * No phone was attached to the machine this landed from, and the emulator on
 * it has never booted (four SIGSEGVs in SwiftShader's JIT, measured in round
 * 3). The JVM suites carry the proof that the two causes above are fixed; this
 * file is what turns that into a claim about Android, and it is unverified
 * until somebody runs `connectedDebugAndroidTest` with a phone plugged in.
