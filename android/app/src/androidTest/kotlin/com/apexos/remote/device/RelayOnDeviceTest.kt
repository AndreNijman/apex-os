/**
 * The relay leg, from a real phone, through the real deployed relay.
 *
 * ## What makes this the relay leg and not the LAN one
 *
 * The phone and the computer are on the same Wi-Fi — that is what makes the
 * rest of this suite possible — so simply connecting would take the direct
 * path every time and prove nothing about the relay. The offer the daemon
 * mints is therefore copied with **`lan = emptyList()`**, which `Pairing.kt`
 * documents as a complete payload, and the copy is what this phone is given.
 * `PairingService` then has one path available and has to take it.
 *
 * Nothing else is weakened. The key is the real key, the token is the real
 * one-time token, the rendezvous is derived from the key this phone pins, and
 * the Noise handshake runs end to end through a relay that holds neither half
 * of it. The desktop is `apex-remoted` holding the same rendezvous as the host,
 * started with `--relay` by `run-device-suite.sh`.
 *
 * ## What it can conclude, and what it cannot
 *
 * It concludes that a phone reaches this computer through Cloudflare's Worker,
 * its Durable Object and a custom-domain TLS termination — none of which any
 * double stands in for — and that the session that comes back is labelled as a
 * relayed one. It does **not** conclude that the phone would work from another
 * network: it is still on this one, and the relay leg is being taken because
 * the LAN addresses were withheld rather than because they were unreachable.
 * Proving the second needs a phone on mobile data and a person to hold it.
