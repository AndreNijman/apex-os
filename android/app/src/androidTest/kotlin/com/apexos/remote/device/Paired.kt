/**
 * A phone paired with the real desktop, for every suite that needs one.
 *
 * ## The one thing on this phone that is faked, named once
 *
 * [PlainBox]. `KeystoreSecretBox` gates the device key behind a
 * `BiometricPrompt`, and no `adb` verb presents a fingerprint on real
 * hardware, so the box handed to [PairingService] here protects nothing.
 * Everything else is real: the radio, the two daemons, the Noise handshakes,
 * the device store on disk, and `PairingService` itself — the production
 * class, not a copy of it.
 *
 * It lives in one file because it is the substitution the suite has to keep
 * being honest about. Two copies would be two places for the `false` below to
 * drift into a `true`, and the whole value of that flag is that it is not
 * flattering.
