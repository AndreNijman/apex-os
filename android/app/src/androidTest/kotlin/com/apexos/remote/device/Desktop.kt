/**
 * The desktop, as the on-device suite can reach it.
 *
 * `apex-remoted`'s control socket is a unix socket on the computer and a phone
 * can never touch one, so `tools/run-device-suite.sh` puts a line-JSON broker
 * in front of it and passes this test the address. Every offer the suite pairs
 * with, and every revocation it asserts against, is minted by the REAL daemon
 * through that broker — the broker itself decides nothing.
 *
 * A missing argument is a **failure and never a skip**. An instrumented suite
 * that quietly passed when nobody told it where the desktop was would be a
 * green run asserting nothing, which is the failure mode this whole program
 * has shipped more than once.
