/**
 * The terminal, on a real screen, attached to a real PTY on the computer.
 *
 * ## Why this file is not part of `Screens.kt`
 *
 * `Screens.all` is the list the accessibility, large-text and landscape walks
 * share, and it is deliberately terminal-free: every screen on it composes
 * from data alone, and a `TerminalScreen` built on a half-controller would
 * assert something no user ever sees. The terminal's own answer is not a
 * stubbed composition — it is this: pair with the computer, start a session on
 * it, attach, and drive the real `TerminalController` the app builds.
 *
 * ## Why this file does not use the Compose test rule, which every other
 * ## on-device test here does
 *
 * **Historically because it could not**, and that has changed: what follows is
 * kept because it is the record of a defect, not a standing claim.
 *
 * `TerminalScreen` used to run a `withFrameNanos` loop for the life of the
 * composition, so the Recomposer always had pending work; `ComposeTestRule.
 * setContent` ends by waiting for idleness, and on this screen that wait never
 * returned. Measured on the Pixel 7a: all three tests below failed inside
 * `setContent` with `IdlingResourceTimeoutException: Wait for [Compose-Espresso
 * link] to become idle timed out … hadRecomposerChanges = true`. That reads
 * as a limit of the harness and it was not — an idle terminal asking the
 * Choreographer for sixty frames a second is a battery defect on a phone
 * whether or not anything is testing it. It is fixed in `TerminalFrames`,
 * together with a second perpetual animation nobody had noticed: the hidden
 * field's transparent cursor, which foundation blinks for ever because a
 * transparent brush is a *specified* one. `TerminalHarnessOnDeviceTest` is the
 * on-device assertion that the standard rule can now host this screen.
 *
 * This file keeps its own host anyway, and for a better reason than it had
 * before: it drives a real PTY across a real network, so every wait here is on
 * a condition about the MACHINE — attached, echoed, resized — with its own
 * deadline. Espresso's idleness would answer a different question.
 *
 * ## What it closes, and in whose words
 *
 * P1-060 C1 names **PTY input/output** end to end, and round 1's evidence said
 * plainly what it still lacked: "no PTY output read back over an attach from
 * the device". Every byte asserted below crossed Wi-Fi twice — through
 * `apex-remoted`, into `apex-agentd`, onto a PTY master, through `/bin/cat`,
 * and back up the same path into `Terminal.feed` on this phone.
 *
 * P1-060 C2 names **rotation** and **large text**, and `LayoutOnDeviceTest`
 * answers those for the six data screens. The terminal is the screen where
 * they matter most and it was the one with no device evidence at all: text
 * size decides how many columns fit, and orientation decides it again.
 * `onSizeChanged` turns both into a `resize` the computer is told about, so
 * what is asserted is that the grid this phone measured in landscape at font
 * scale 2.0 is the grid the PTY on the other end is running at.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT claim
 *
 * Anything about a screen reader. `TerminalView` is still a bare `Canvas` and
 * still composes not one glyph, so what TalkBack reads is what
 * `TerminalReading` puts in the tree beside it — asserted on the values in
 * `TerminalSemanticsTest`, and on a phone in `TerminalHarnessOnDeviceTest`,
 * neither of which needs a machine at the other end. Nothing below looks at
 * the semantics tree at all.
