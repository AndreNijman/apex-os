/**
 * The control plane: one connection, used for asking a machine questions.
 *
 * ## Why it is not the PTY's connection
 *
 * Because the PTY's connection is busy being a PTY. `rime-remoted` answers a
 * control frame from a single-threaded loop that **blocks while `rime-agentd`
 * thinks** — `serve.rs` — and a privilege request legitimately waits as long
 * as the person does, which is why `Mux.CONTROL_TIMEOUT_MS` is five minutes.
 * Sharing one connection would mean a list refresh could sit behind a prompt
 * somebody has gone to lunch without answering, with the terminal frozen
 * behind it.
 *
 * There is no per-device connection cap on the far side to make this
 * expensive: `rime-remoted` opens a fresh unix connection to `rime-agentd` per
 * control round trip anyway, and `net.rs` caps message size rather than
 * connections. Checked, rather than assumed.
 *
 * ## Reconnecting is a property of asking, not of a loop
 *
 * There is no reconnect *thread* here, and that is deliberate. A dead
 * connection is noticed on the next question and replaced then — or, since
 * the phone started holding this connection open on purpose (the foreground
 * service in `:app`), by whoever is holding it: [connectNow] opens one without
 * asking anything, and [LinkEvent.Dropped] is the cue to call it again. The
 * policy of WHEN to reconnect lives with the holder, because only the holder
 * knows whether anybody still wants the connection.
 *
 * ## A dead connection is noticed within forty seconds, not five minutes
 *
 * `rime-remoted` pings every fifteen seconds from a thread of its own, so an
 * idle control connection still has traffic, and a connection with NO traffic
 * for [SILENCE_MS] is gone — a phone that walked out of Wi-Fi range does not
 * get a FIN. Before the watchdog, a request on such a connection waited out
 * [Mux.CONTROL_TIMEOUT_MS], five minutes, which is how "it takes ages" was
 * sometimes simply "it is waiting on a socket that died a while ago". The
 * watchdog closes the connection, which fails every waiting request with
 * [Disconnected] at once, so a question is retried on a fresh connection and
 * an instruction is reported as not known to have landed.
 *
 * Five minutes stays the per-request ceiling, and that is not a contradiction:
 * a request waiting on a human is on a connection whose pings are still
 * arriving, and the watchdog never touches a connection that is talking.
 *
 * ## Terminals can ride it (`mux_attach`)
 *
 * Against a machine whose `rime-remoted` advertises [Features.MUX_ATTACH], a
 * terminal opens a channel on THIS connection ([shared]) instead of dialling
 * its own — which was a full handshake, over the relay as often as not, every
 * time a terminal was opened. Such a machine answers control requests on a
 * worker so the frame loop, and the terminal's bytes, keep moving while one is
 * slow. Against any other machine the note below still holds, and terminals
 * still dial their own.
 *
 * One retry, and only for [Disconnected]: a request that reached the daemon
 * and was refused must not be sent twice. `signal` is the case that makes this
 * more than tidiness — a `SIGTERM` delivered twice because the reply was lost
 * is a second signal into whatever the agent was doing next.
