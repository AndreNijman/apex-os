 * The strings a machine advertises, and the only way this app decides to use
 * something newer than the oldest machine it talks to.
 *
 * Two lists, from two processes, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 * * `rime-agentd`'s `hello` carries [Hello.features] — what the RUNTIME can do
 *   with a session: submit a typed reply, rename, peek.
 * * `rime-remoted`'s own `remote_hello` carries [RemoteHello.features] — what
 *   the CONNECTION can do: whether a terminal may share the control
 *   connection, whether it expects pongs.
 *
 * A phone and a desktop are updated by different people at different times —
 * the OS through `rime update`, this app through its own release — so every
 * one of these is feature-detected and every one has a fallback that is
 * today's behaviour. Nothing here is inferred from a version number: a
 * version cannot say that a fix was backported, and trying a verb to see
 * whether it is refused is not an option for `input`, where the refusal would
 * arrive after the sentence was already typed.

 * Session names: the rule for what a person may call one, and what a screen
 * may draw.
 *
 * ## The rule is the daemon's, repeated here for a better sentence
 *
 * `rime-agent-core` has one validation function and the daemon and the CLI
 * both use it: trim; empty means "clear the name"; at most [MAX_CHARS]
 * characters; no control characters; refused, never sanitised. This is the
 * same rule so that a phone can say "that name is 70 characters, the limit is
 * 64" while the dialog is still open, rather than sending it and showing a
 * refusal from a machine. The daemon checks again and its answer is the one
 * that counts.
 *
 * "Characters" means what Rust's `chars().count()` means — Unicode scalar
 * values — which is `codePointCount` here and NOT `String.length`: Kotlin
 * counts UTF-16 units, so a name of 64 emoji is 128 long in Kotlin and 64 to
 * the daemon. Counting the Kotlin way would refuse names the machine accepts.
 *
 * "Control" is Rust's `char::is_control`, the Unicode general category Cc:
 * U+0000–U+001F and U+007F–U+009F. That is `Character.getType == CONTROL`,
 * checked per code point.
