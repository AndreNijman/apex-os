/**
 * `rime-agentd`'s `SessionInfo`, as much of it as a phone shows.
 *
 * ## The shapes that catch people
 *
 * * **`Response::Session` does not nest.** It is a serde newtype variant under
 *   an internal tag, so the session's fields sit *beside* `"reply"` rather
 *   than under a `"session"` key. `Response::Sessions` does nest, because
 *   serde cannot serialise a newtype variant wrapping a sequence at all.
 * * **Nothing is `skip_serializing_if`.** An absent optional arrives as
 *   `null`, and `children` arrives as `[]` rather than being missing — the
 *   daemon's own comment says the distinction is load-bearing: an empty list
 *   means "asked and found none", a missing key would mean "this daemon does
 *   not have the graph".
 * * **`started` and `last_activity` are unix SECONDS.** Everything else with a
 *   time in it — `grant_expires_ms`, `ttl_ms` — is milliseconds.
 * * The policy is flattened into the session, so `sandbox`, `network` and the
 *   rest are top-level keys. `origin` among them is policy dimension six;
 *   *which* origin asked is the separate `request_origin`, in kebab-case.

     * argument that asking for less meant reconnecting into a terminal missing
     * the part that mattered. What that cost was measured by the person using
     * it: opening a terminal took long enough to be the complaint. A replay is
     * paid on every attach and every reconnect, over a relay as often as not,
     * and the phone's screen shows perhaps sixty rows of it. 64 KiB is still
     * several hundred lines at eighty columns — far more than the screen and a
     * good way back through the scrollback — for a quarter of the bytes.
     *
     * Anybody who needs the whole history has the transcript on the machine,
     * and a session that is open on the desktop has all of it there.
