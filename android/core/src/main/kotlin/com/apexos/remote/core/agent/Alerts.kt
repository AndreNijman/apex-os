/**
 * What is worth telling the user about, and once.
 *
 * ## There are now TWO ways an alert arrives, and this file is one of them
 *
 * This class turns **polls of a connection the phone opened** into alerts, and
 * that path works only while the app is running. The other is push: since
 * P1-058 the desktop runs the same rules itself, in
 * `apexd/apex-remoted/src/push.rs`, and posts an opaque envelope to a
 * UnifiedPush distributor — which reaches this phone with the app closed, the
 * screen off and the network suspended in Doze. See [Push] for the envelope
 * and `docs/remote.md` for what the user has to install.
 *
 * The two paths raise the *same* alerts, and that is deliberate rather than
 * redundant: push needs a distributor the user may not have, and the poll
 * needs an app that may not be running. What stops the overlap showing up as
 * two notifications is [NotificationContent.idFor] — the id is derived from
 * (machine, session, kind), so a pushed alert and a polled alert for one
 * moment REPLACE each other in the shade instead of stacking.
 *
 * **The earlier text here said there was no push transport anywhere in APEX,
 * and that the relay had never been deployed. Both were true when written and
 * neither is now**: the relay is serving at `apex-relay.andrenijman.com`, and
 * the push path above exists. The relay is still not what carries a push, and
 * the reason is worth keeping — it is a rendezvous that both ends dial into at
 * the same time, which is precisely the situation push exists to handle the
 * absence of.
 *
 * ## What must never be in an alert
 *
 * `SessionInfo.detail` is built by `hook::detail_for` and copies **verbatim**,
 * clipped to 120 characters: Bash command lines, file paths, grep patterns,
 * fetched URLs, task descriptions, and Claude's own notification text. It is
 * the single most sensitive field on the record and it is never carried here.
 * Nor are `cwd`, `project`, `worktree`, `args` or `telemetry.branch`, which
 * name what the user is working on.
 *
 * An [Alert] is `(machine, session id, kind, agent)`. The words the user reads
 * come from [AgentStates.label] and this file, both of which are fixed strings
 * in this build.
