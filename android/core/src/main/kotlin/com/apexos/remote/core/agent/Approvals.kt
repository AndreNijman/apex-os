/**
 * Privilege requests and grants, as a paired phone may see them.
 *
 * ## The fact that shapes every screen built on this file
 *
 * **A phone can never approve or deny a privilege request, and no setting
 * changes that.** `apex-agentd/src/privilege.rs:1176` refuses `decide` from
 * any non-local origin unconditionally:
 *
 * ```rust
 * if !decider.is_local() {
 *     return Response::error(ErrorKind::PermissionDenied, …);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The check sits *before* the pending check, so a phone cannot even deny.
 * `Request::Decide` carries no second factor, and `decide` never consults
 * `OriginPolicy` — the `remote_elevation_allowed` opt-in gates a different
 * path (system-access grant issuance), not this one. `apex-remoted` declares
 * the origin `claude-remote-control` (`proxy.rs:128`), which is not local, and
 * `origin::may_declare` forbids narrowing back towards local. Pinned by
 * `apex-agentd/tests/request_origin.rs:369`.
 *
 * And every verb in the vocabulary is a root operation: `request.rs:290` maps
 * all eight to `Capability::RootCapability`, deliberately, because the
 * vocabulary was chosen to be exactly `apex`'s root-only subcommands.
 *
 * So this file deliberately has **no `decide` builder**. It is recorded as a
 * thing that does not exist rather than left to be noticed, because the
 * obvious next move on seeing a list of pending approvals is to add a button,
 * and that button would be refused by the daemon every time it was pressed.
 * [DECIDE_IS_LOCAL_ONLY] is what a screen shows instead.
 *
 * ## What a phone CAN do here
 *
 * List requests, list per-project grants, list system-access grants, and
 * **revoke** either kind — `revoke` and `revoke_system_grant` are gated on the
 * caller not being a managed session, and carry no origin check at all
 * (`privilege.rs:1289`, `privilege.rs:865`). Revocation only ever removes
 * authority, which is why it is safe from a device that cannot grant any.
