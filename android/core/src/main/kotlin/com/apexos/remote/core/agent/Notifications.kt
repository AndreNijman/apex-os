/**
 * What a notification says, decided where a test can read it.
 *
 * Every rule about notification CONTENT lives in this file rather than at the
 * `NotificationCompat.Builder` call, because nothing in this project can test
 * that call: there is no device, no emulator, no Robolectric, and
 * `assembleDebug` compiles the builder without running it. A privacy rule
 * enforced only inside an Android class is a privacy rule with no gate in
 * front of it.
 *
 * ## The criterion this file is the answer to, stated honestly
 *
 * P1-058 asks that "notification content is encrypted/minimized so push
 * infrastructure does not receive sensitive prompt/code content". **No push
 * infrastructure receives anything, because there is none** — see the head of
 * `Alerts.kt` for the measurement. What is left of the criterion, and the part
 * that is real, is *minimized*: the words on the lock screen. A phone on a
 * table shows its notifications to whoever is in the room, and that is a
 * disclosure channel whether or not a server was involved.
 *
 * So the rule is the one the criterion would want if the transport existed:
 * **an alert renders from fixed strings, a machine name and an adapter name,
 * and from nothing else.** In particular `SessionInfo.detail` never reaches
 * here. It is built by `hook::detail_for` (`hook.rs:437`) and copies verbatim,
 * clipped to 120 characters: Bash command lines, file paths, grep patterns,
 * fetched URLs, task descriptions and Claude's own notification text. It is
 * the most sensitive field on the record and it is the one a notification
 * would most naturally want. [Alert] does not carry it, this file could not
 * reach it, and `NotificationsTest` drives a session whose detail is a secret
 * through the whole watcher-to-notification path and asserts the secret is in
 * none of the rendered fields.
 *
 * Nor are `cwd`, `project`, `worktree`, `args` or `telemetry.branch` carried:
 * they name what the user is working on, which is the thing a person reading
 * over a shoulder learns the most from.

    /**
     * The Android notification id.
     *
     * Derived from [Alert.Key] and stable for it, so that a session which
     * enters `waiting_for_user`, is answered, and enters it again REPLACES its
     * notification rather than stacking a second one. Four paths inside APEX
     * publish `waiting_for_user` for one turn (see [Alert.Key]); the watcher
     * already collapses those to one alert, and this makes the notification
     * survive the case the watcher cannot see — an app restart, which empties
     * the watcher and makes the next poll a first poll.
