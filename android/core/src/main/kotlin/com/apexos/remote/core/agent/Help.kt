/**
 * The in-app guide (P1-060), and its agreement with the desktop's.
 *
 * ## Why the words live in `:core`
 *
 * For the reason `AgentHelpContent.qml` exists on the desktop: prose in one
 * file can be read start to finish, and a test can hold it to the stop-slop
 * rules without scanning UI code around it. It also means `HelpParityTest` can
 * compare this against a vendored copy of the desktop's file, which is the only
 * way "equivalent to desktop Agents/Workspaces help" is a claim anybody can
 * check rather than a claim somebody made.
 *
 * ## Equivalent is not identical, and the difference is written down
 *
 * The two clients do not have the same powers. A phone cannot approve a root
 * operation, cannot restore a checkpoint, and cannot turn the agent runtime on.
 * Help that repeated the desktop's instructions would be telling somebody
 * holding a phone to do things they cannot do from it, which is worse than
 * saying less.
 *
 * So the SECTIONS match one for one — that is what the parity test asserts —
 * and where a section's content differs it says what this device can do and
 * names what it cannot. [Section.desktopId] is the link between the two, and
 * a desktop section with no counterpart has to be listed in the parity test's
 * allowlist with a reason, so dropping one is a decision somebody writes down
 * rather than a gap nobody notices.
