/**
 * One file, from this phone to a running agent (P1-059 criterion 2).
 *
 * ## Why this is a channel and not a request
 *
 * `Request::Receive` is the second verb on this protocol that takes a
 * connection over; `attach` is the other. The daemon answers `receiving`, then
 * reads exactly `len` bytes off the same connection, then answers again with
 * the `injected` reply. So it travels as a `Frame.Open` payload — and
 * `apex-remoted` refuses it on channel zero by name, for the same reason it
 * refuses `attach` there: the daemon would be blocked reading an upload that
 * never comes while the proxy blocks reading a reply that never comes.
 *
 * ## Why it gets a connection of its own
 *
 * [Mux] is strictly FIFO on the control channel — `apex-remoted` answers from
 * a single-threaded loop and there is no request id on the wire, so the only
 * thing pairing a reply with its request is arrival order. That ordering is
 * fine for an upload's own two replies. What is not fine is what an upload
 * does to everything ELSE on that connection: two megabytes of `Data` frames
 * ahead of a `list` is a session list that arrives when the photo finishes.
 * `PtyAttachment` already takes a connection per terminal for a related
 * reason, so this is the existing shape rather than a new one.
 *
 * ## The bytes, and the one number that is checked twice
 *
 * `len` is declared before anything is sent and the daemon commits to it in
 * the reply — it refuses an oversize upload BEFORE the takeover, so nothing
 * crosses a mobile connection to be discarded. This class checks the same cap
 * first ([Handoff.Files.MAX_BYTES]) so a phone does not spend a round trip
 * learning a number it already had, and then sends exactly that many bytes: a
 * source that turns out to be longer is a refusal, not a truncation, because a
 * truncated screenshot that the agent is told is a screenshot is worse than
 * an error.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT do
 *
 * It does not name the destination, reduce the file's name, or decide what is
 * typed into the terminal. All three are the daemon's, and a second
 * implementation here would be a second thing to keep in step —
 * [Handoff.Files.preview] shows the user what the daemon will do without
 * being what does it.
 *
 * ## Threading
 *
 * Every method here blocks on a socket, so every one of them is a
 * `NetworkOnMainThreadException` waiting to happen: Android installs
 * `StrictMode.enableDeathOnNetwork()` for any app targeting API 11 or later
 * and a debug build does not relax it. Callers run this inside
 * `withContext(Dispatchers.IO)`. It is not a `suspend` function because
 * `:core` has no coroutines dependency and the rest of the link layer is
 * blocking for the same reason.
