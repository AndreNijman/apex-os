/**
 * The push envelope, and the rules around it (P1-058).
 *
 * `apexd/apex-remote-core/src/push.rs` is the specification; this is the other
 * end of it. Everything that can be a rule is here, in `:core`, where a JVM
 * test can reach it — the `BroadcastReceiver` in `:app` is plumbing only, for
 * the same reason `Notifier` is.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * Until now an alert reached this phone only while the app was running and its
 * poll loop was alive. A phone in a pocket with the screen off got nothing:
 * `com.apexos.remote` is not on Android's Doze whitelist — measured on a real
 * GrapheneOS device, `dumpsys deviceidle whitelist` has zero matches — so the
 * platform suspends its network and an agent that needs somebody reaches
 * nobody.
 *
 * A UnifiedPush distributor is what solves that, because it is the app the
 * user installed *in order to* hold a connection open, and it is the one the
 * platform exempts. APEX Remote holds nothing open, runs no foreground
 * service, and depends on no Google component.
 *
 * ## Why the payload is opaque to everything that carries it
 *
 * P1-058's second criterion asks that the push infrastructure not receive
 * sensitive prompt or code content. What crosses it is [ENVELOPE_LEN] bytes of
 * which 38 are ciphertext, and the plaintext is five fixed-width integers —
 * there is no field in it that can hold a sentence. The push server and the
 * distributor learn that a registration received something, when, and that it
 * was 51 bytes; the size is the same for every kind, so even *which* kind it
 * was does not leak.
 *
 * The key is this phone's: generated here by [newKey], handed to one machine
 * inside the already-authenticated Noise channel, and stored beside that
 * machine's record. It is deliberately **not** derived from the device
 * identity key, and that is not a shortcut — [StaticKeyIsUnreachableHere]
 * explains why it could not be.

     *
     * * no registration at all — this phone has no distributor, or has never
     *   asked one for this machine;
     * * a registration whose endpoint has not arrived yet (it is empty while
     *   the distributor is thinking);
     * * one that arrived unusable — [UnifiedPush.checkEndpoint] applies the
     *   same rules `push.rs`'s `Endpoint::parse` does, so a phone does not
     *   burn a round trip to be told what it could see for itself;
     * * an endpoint this machine has already been told, which is the ordinary
     *   case on every reconnection after the first.
     *
     * A distributor rotating the endpoint writes
     * [com.apexos.remote.core.PushRegistration.endpoint] and leaves
     * [com.apexos.remote.core.PushRegistration.sentEndpoint] behind, so the
     * next connection sends once and then stops. That is why the two fields

 * `REGISTRATION_FAILED` with reason [REASON_VAPID_REQUIRED], and
