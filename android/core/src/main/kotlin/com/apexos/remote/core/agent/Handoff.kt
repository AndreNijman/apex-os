/**
 * Voice, clipboard and file handoff from the phone to an agent (P1-059).
 *
 * Three of P1-059's four criteria are about pushing something the person is
 * holding — a sentence they said, something they copied, a photo they took —
 * into an agent that is already running. One verb carries all of it that this
 * protocol can carry, and one of the three has no transport at all. This file
 * is where each of those is decided, and where the one that cannot be done
 * says so rather than being approximated.
 *
 * ## The verb, and the fact that it appends nothing
 *
 * `Request::Input { id, data }` writes `data` to the session's PTY master with
 * `session::write_input`, which the protocol documents as writing it "verbatim
 * and no byte is added". Two consequences run through everything below.
 *
 * **Bytes on a PTY are keystrokes.** There is no field in a terminal for "this
 * came from a phone". A `\n` in the middle of pasted text is not text; it is
 * the return key, pressed at that point, and everything after it is typed into
 * whatever the agent asked next. An `ESC` is not a character; it is the first
 * byte of whatever sequence follows it. `Agentd.escape` carries control bytes
 * through the JSON faithfully, so an escaped 0x1b arrives as one 0x1b byte — the
 * escaping is correct and is precisely why the hazard survives to the terminal.
 *
 * **A machine's guess is read by a human before it becomes an instruction —
 * and on a phone that happens BEFORE the send, not after.** The desktop stages:
 * `apex agent input <id> <text>` takes a `--submit` flag and
 * `PushToTalkService.qml` does not pass it, so the words wait on the agent's
 * input line for the person sitting at that machine to press Enter. The rule is
 * right and the placement is right *there*, because the reviewer is at the
 * keyboard.
 *
 * The phone's user is not. Words staged on a machine nobody is standing at are
 * words in a terminal nobody will look at until they walk back to it, and a
 * push-to-talk whose result appears twenty minutes later at a desk is not the
 * feature anybody asked for. So the review happens where the person is: a
 * transcript and a clipboard are put into the reply box, on the phone, where
 * they can be read and edited, and the Send button is the same one a typed
 * reply uses.
 *
 * That is why [Voice.forReview] and [Clipboard.forReview] produce text for a
 * text field and not bytes for a socket, and why there is exactly one path to
 * the wire: [com.apexos.remote.core.agent.Reply.bytes], through
 * `Reply.check`'s recycled-id guard. A second send path would be a second
 * place for that guard to be forgotten, and forgetting it types somebody's
 * sentence into a stranger's terminal.

    /**
     * Speaking to a named agent.
     *
     * The rules are the desktop's, from `apex-shell/src/services/pushtotalk.js`,
     * and they are reproduced rather than reinvented so that the same feature
     * does not mean two things on two clients. Two of them are the whole design:
     *
     * 1. **The target is resolved before the microphone opens.** A refusal keeps
     *    the phase at [Phase.IDLE]. There is no reachable path on which the
     *    phase is [Phase.RECORDING] and the target is null — "a recording with
     *    nowhere to go is a hot microphone with a reason to feel fine about
     *    itself".
     * 2. **The target is frozen when recording starts.** A person talking to a
     *    computer looks away from it; a route re-resolved at delivery would
     *    send the words wherever the phone had drifted to.
     *
     * ## This app does not hold the microphone, and that is the design
     *
     * Speech reaches it through `RecognizerIntent.ACTION_RECOGNIZE_SPEECH`:
     * the system's own recogniser opens, shows the system's own microphone
     * indicator, and hands back text. **`RECORD_AUDIO` is not in the
     * manifest** and no audio ever enters this process. That is the same rule
     * P1-059's fourth criterion applies to the photo library, applied to the
     * microphone — take the Android-mediated selection, never the blanket
     * permission — and it is worth more here than convenience, because this is
     * the app that shows which machine is about to run something as root.
     *
     * The desktop's third rule is therefore inherited with its reason changed
     * rather than copied. `pushtotalk.js` needs [MAX_MS] because push-to-talk
     * there is a *toggle*: niri fires nothing on key release, so hold-to-talk
     * is unimplementable on one of its three compositors and one semantic
     * everywhere had to be the toggle, and a toggle's failure is a microphone
     * left open. This app cannot leave a microphone open — it never had one.
     *
     * The cap is kept at the same ninety seconds anyway, because the failure it
     * prevents arrives here by a different road: a result that never comes.
     * The recogniser is another process, and another process can be killed,
     * swiped away, or replaced while this app is in the background. Without the
     * cap that leaves push-to-talk in [Phase.RECORDING] with a destination held
     * and no event that will ever leave it, which reads to the user as a mic
     * button that has stopped working. [expired] is what unsticks it.
     *
     * This reducer is agnostic about what produced [stop] — a returning
     * activity result, a second tap, the cap — and is not agnostic about
     * something having produced it.

    /**
     * Sending what is on the phone's clipboard to an agent.
     *
     * ## Send is real. Receive is not, and this says so instead of pretending.
     *
     * There is **no verb on this socket that reads the machine's clipboard**.
     * The full wire vocabulary is 28 verbs and none of them is a clipboard
     * verb. `apex send --clipboard` is real and is a different feature wearing
     * a similar name: `apexd/apex/src/dispatch.rs` shells out to `wl-paste`,
     * ssh's the bytes to another **Linux host in the §20 registry** and runs
     * `wl-copy` there. A phone is not an ssh destination running `wl-copy`, so
     * that path is not reachable from here and adding it would mean a verb, a
     * daemon-side clipboard reader and a Wayland session to read it from.
     *
     * What exists in the receive direction is the terminal's own copy: the
     * session screen selects and copies what is on it, which covers "get that
     * command off the machine" and does not cover "get what the machine
     * copied". P1-059's third criterion is therefore half met, and it is
     * recorded that way.
     *
     * ## Why a paste is not a reply
     *
     * `Reply.bytes` trims the ends and appends CR, which is right for a
     * sentence someone typed into a box. A clipboard is not that. It holds
     * whatever was last copied — a stack trace, a URL, a chunk of a file — and
     * `Input` writes it to a PTY **verbatim**. Every interior newline is a
     * press of the return key at that point, so a three-line paste submits the
     * first line and types the other two into whatever the agent asked next. An
     * `ESC` is the start of a control sequence, and TUIs act on those.
     *
     * The daemon does not help here and could not: `inject` wraps its path in
     * bracketed-paste markers when `OutputScanner` has seen the application set
     * DECSET 2004, because the daemon *is* the terminal and knows. `input`
     * brackets nothing, and a phone has no way to learn whether the mode is on.
     *
     * ## [inspect] runs on the BOX, not on the clipboard
     *
     * This is the placement that matters and the first attempt got it wrong.
     * A rule that only ran when the user tapped a *Send clipboard* button
     * would be bypassed by the ordinary way anybody pastes: long-press the
     * reply field, tap Paste. The IME writes straight into the text field,
     * no code of this app's runs, and the three-line stack trace goes to
     * [Reply.bytes] — which trims the ends, adds CR, and submits at the first
     * interior newline with the remaining two lines typed into whatever the
     * agent asks next.
     *
     * So [inspect] is a gate on **the send**, applied to whatever is in the box
     * however it got there — typed, dictated, pasted by the keyboard, or put
     * there by this app's own button. The button is a convenience over a rule
     * the send applies anyway, which is the only arrangement in which the rule
     * cannot be walked around.
     *
     * Nothing is silently stripped. Text somebody chose to paste is text they
     * chose; a send that quietly delivered something else would be worse than
     * one that stopped and asked.

     * P1-059's second criterion, and why no code here meets it.
     *
     * > Photo/screenshot/file upload lands in an explicit permitted
     * > project/temp path and inserts a safe path into the agent session.
     *
     * The destination half of that is **built and working on the desktop**.
     * `apex_agent_core::inject` copies a file into the session's own scratch
     * `inbox/`, names the copy from an allowlist of 64 characters so no byte of
     * the user's filename reaches the PTY unreduced, types the path, submits
     * nothing, and mirrors every handover to `systemd-journald` where the
     * session cannot rewrite it. P1-035 landed all of it. A phone does not need
     * a new destination; it needs a way to get the bytes there.
     *
     * **There is no such way, and the arithmetic says how far off it is.** The
     * wire vocabulary has no verb that carries file content. The nearest
     * relative is `Request::Inject { id, source }`, whose `source` is a path on
     * the **host** read with the daemon's own access — which is why this round
     * gated it to local origins after finding a paired phone could have named
     * `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` with it.
     *
     * Carrying bytes in a request instead would mean base64 in JSON inside one
     * `Frame::Control`, and `apex_remote_core::wire::MAX_PAYLOAD` is 65514
     * bytes. Base64 costs four bytes for three, the JSON envelope takes its
     * share, and what is left is about **48 KB of file**. A phone screenshot is
     * 100 KB to 2 MB. A verb built to that shape would carry a log tail and
     * refuse a screenshot — the feature's own name — which is the mistake this
     * app has already made once, building a request nothing could parse.
     *
     * Doing it honestly is a chunked transfer: begin, chunk, end, with staging
     * state in the daemon, a size cap, a timeout, cleanup for an upload that is
     * abandoned halfway, and the origin gate above applied to the destination
     * rather than to the source. That is a protocol unit and it is named as one
     * rather than started at the end of an Android round.
     *
     * ## What this app does instead
     *
     * It does not offer the button. A picker that opened, took a photo and then
     * said the machine could not receive it would be worse than no picker: the
     * user has already granted access to that image by the time they learn.
     * [WHY] is what the Session screen shows where the control would be, in the
     * app's own words, so the absence is explained where somebody looks for it.
