/**
 * A stand-in for `apex-remoted`, with a hand on the plug.
 *
 * ## Why a fake and not the real handshake
 *
 * `RealSessionReconnectTest` does use the real thing — two live `Noise_IK`
 * handshakes over pipes — because a reconnect that never re-handshakes is not
 * a reconnect. What that test cannot do is decide *when* the connection dies.
 * "The socket failed after 400 bytes of a scrollback replay, in the middle of
 * an escape sequence" has to be a case somebody chose, or it is an accident of
 * timing that passes on a machine that is busy and fails on one that is not.
 *
 * ## What it models, from `serve.rs`
 *
 * * A `Control` frame is answered with exactly one `Control` frame, in order,
 *   from a single-threaded loop.
 * * An `Open` is answered with a `Control` frame carrying the daemon's reply,
 *   and then, when that reply was `attached`, the scrollback as `Data` frames
 *   on the opened channel.
 * * A refusal the daemon spoke — "no such session" — is `Control(reply)` and
 *   then `Close(channel, "")`.
 * * A failure the proxy hit is **`Close(channel, reason)` and no `Control` at
 *   all**, which is the ordering trap the multiplexer exists to survive.
